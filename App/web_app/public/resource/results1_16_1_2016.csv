18,"Transcriptional regulation is effected through consensus sequences in the FBP1 promoter region for the repressor Mig1p, the activating HAP complex, and the derepressing zinc finger protein Cat8p (10, reviewed in 6)."
15,"Transcription of MET17 is mainly regulated by the transcription factors of the sulfur metabolic network; it is positively regulated by Met4p and Cbf1p and negatively regulated by Met31p and Met32p (10, 11, 12, 13)."
29,"The regulation of CAR1 expression is complex, as the CAR1 promoter region contains one upstreamThe regulation of CAR1 expression is complex, as the CAR1 promoter region contains one upstream repression site (URS) and four upstream activation sites (UAS) (17). The URS is bound by the global repressor Ume6p, which forms a complex with Sin3p and Rpd3p that downregulates CAR1 expression (18)."
6,"Conversely, the negative regulator Opi1p facilitates GUT1 repression (2, 6)."
40,CCC2 expression is regulated by iron and AFT1 (17).
16,"MET17 expression can also be regulated by Gcn4p, Cbf1p, and Sir4p (14, 15, 16, 17)."
42,"Arg82p is involved in regulating this process by stabilizing the transcription factors Mcm1p and Arg80p (13, 4)."
44,"UME6 (Unscheduled Meiotic gene Expression) is a key transcriptional regulator of early meiotic genes, such as SPO11, SPO13, and IME2 (15)."
45,"SIR1 is one of four Silent Information Regulator genes in yeast. It encodes a nuclear protein that helps silence transcription of the cryptic mating type loci HML and HMR (1, 4, 5)."
48,"Rap1p is known to be required for the transcription of several non-ribosomal protein genes, including HIS4 (14), ENO1 and ENO2 (15), and is implicated in transcriptional regulation of 185 additional genes (7)."
