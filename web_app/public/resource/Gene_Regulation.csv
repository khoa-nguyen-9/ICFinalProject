S000000178,YBL082C,ALG3,Asparagine Linked Glycosylation,"dolichyl-P-Man:Man(5)GlcNAc(2)-PP-dolichol alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase RHK1","ALG3 encodes an alpha-1,3-mannosyltransferase involved in the first step of N-linked glycosylation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) - the assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO), which then serves as a donor in the second step - the transfer of the oligosaccharide to asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides. The lipid component that anchors the LLO in the ER membrane is dolichol (Dol), a polyisoprenoid molecule composed in yeast of 15-16 isoprene units. The LLO assembly involves sequential additions of two N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), nine mannose (Man), and three glucose (Glc) residues. Alg3p catalyzes the addition of a Man residue to LLO after the earlier steps catalyzed by UDP-GlcNAc transferases Alg7p and Alg13p-Alg14p, an alpha-1,3- and alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase Alg2p, and an alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase Alg11p that take place on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. After the product, Dol-PP-GlcNAc2-Man5, is flipped to the ER lumen by an unknown flippase, the oligosaccharide chain is elongated by four more Man residues, in reactions catalyzed by mannosyltransferases Alg3p, Alg12p and Alg9p, and three Glc residues, catalyzed by glucosyltransferases Alg6p, Alg8p and Alg10p. The final product delivers the 14 glycan molecule to the hetero-oligomeric oligosaccharyltransferase (Ost) complex (Ost1p, Ost2p, Ost3p, Ost4p, Ost5p, Ost6p, Stt3p, Swp1p, and Wbp1p), which transfers the entire oligosaccharide chain to asparagine side chains in polypeptides.

S000000199,YBL103C,RTG3,ReTroGrade regulation,,"RTG1 and RTG3 encode positive regulators of the retrograde (RTG) regulatory pathway, which responds to mitochondrial dysfunction and to growth on nitrogen sources requiring alpha-ketoglutarate for nitrogen assimilation.  The RTG pathway provides for ammonium assimilation from poor nitrogen sources and a source of glutamate in the absence of mitochondrial function. Rtg1p and Rtg3p form a heterodimeric transcriptional activator whose nuclear localization is regulated in response to mitochondrial integrity and nitrogen availability. When nitrogen is available and mitochondria are functional, Rtg1p/Rtg3p resides in the cytoplasm. Reduction in mitochondrial function or depletion of nitrogen results in nuclear localization of Rtg1p/Rtg3p and subsequent activation of target genes. Regulation of the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of Rtg1p/Rtg3p involves Mks1p, Rtg2p, and Bmh1p/Bmh2p. When phosphorylated, Mks1p forms an anchor complex with Bmh1p/Bmh2p that keeps Rtg1p/Rtg3p in the cytoplasm. Rtg2p regulates the subcellular location of the Rtg1p/Rtg3p heterodimer, and can relieve its cytoplasmic sequestration by competing for Bmh1p/Bmh2p binding to Mks1p.",22964838,Broach JR (2012) Nutritional control of growth and development in yeast.

S000000274,YBR070C,ALG14,Asparagine Linked Glycosylation,N-acetylglucosaminyldiphosphodolichol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase anchoring subunit ALG14,"ALG14 encodes an anchoring subunit of a UDP-GlcNAc transferase involved in the first step of N-linked glycosylation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) - the assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO), which then serves as a donor in the second step - the transfer of the oligosaccharide to asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides. The lipid component that anchors the LLO in the ER membrane is dolichol (Dol), a polyisoprenoid molecule composed in yeast of 15-16 isoprene units. The LLO assembly involves sequential additions of two N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), nine mannose (Man), and three glucose (Glc) residues. Alg14p forms a complex with its catalytic subunit Alg14p and the complex catalyzes the second step in this process, the addition of the second GlcNAc moiety to Dol-PP-GlcNAc, the product of an earlier reaction catalyzed by UDP-GlcNAc transferase Alg7p. The subsequent steps involve the addition of one Man molecule by Alg1p, two branching Man molecules by an alpha-1,3- and alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase Alg2p, followed by two consecutive additions of Man by an alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase Alg11p. All these steps take place on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane and the product, Dol-PP-GlcNAc2-Man5, is then flipped to the ER lumen by an unknown flippase. In the ER lumen, the oligosaccharide chain is elongated by four more Man residues, catalyzed by mannosyltransferases Alg3p, Alg12p and Alg9p, and three Glc residues, catalyzed by glucosyltransferases Alg6p, Alg8p and Alg10p. The final product delivers the 14 glycan molecule to the hetero-oligomeric oligosaccharyltransferase (Ost) complex (Ost1p, Ost2p, Ost3p, Ost4p, Ost5p, Ost6p, Stt3p, Swp1p, and Wbp1p), which transfers the entire oligosaccharide chain to asparagine side chains in polypeptides.

The lipid component that anchors the LLO in the ER membrane is dolichol (Dol), a polyisoprenoid molecule composed in yeast of 15-16 isoprene units. The LLO assembly involves sequential additions of two N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), nine mannose (Man), and three glucose (Glc) residues. Alg7p catalyzes the first step in this process, the addition of the GlcNAc moiety to Dol-PP. The subsequent steps involve the addition of the second GlcNAc molecule by the Alg13p-Alg14p complex, one Man molecule by Alg1p, two branching Man molecules by an alpha-1,3- and alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase Alg2p, followed by two consecutive additions of Man by an alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase Alg11p. All these steps take place on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane and the product, Dol-PP-GlcNAc2-Man5, is then flipped to the ER lumen by an unknown flippase.

The entire process that leads to the assembly of the LLO must be strictly ordered and the order appears to be ensured by high substrate specificities of all the participating ALG enzymes.

The pheromone facilitates conjugation of opposite haploid types into 'a'/alpha diploids. Alpha1p is expressed in haploids of the alpha mating type, and is required for the expression of alpha-specific genes. In diploids, expression of ALPHA1 is turned of by the action of the very stable a1-alpha2 corepressor, which turns off haploid-specific genes and allows expression of diploid-specific genes. Alpha1p is rapidly degraded via ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis by the proteasome.

The Mediator complex is highly conserved from yeast to human, and is a central player in the transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes, being required for nearly all transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Mediator bridges activators and the general transcription machinery. The core Mediator complex contains three distinct head, middle, and tail modules. The CKM is a dissociable subcomplex that represses basal transcription.  The other three subunits of the CKM are encoded by SSN3/CDK8/SRB10, SSN8/SRB11, and SSN2/MED13/SRB9. Formation of a Mediator-RNAPII holoenzyme is largely blocked by association of the CKM with the core Mediator complex. Interaction of the CKM with Mediator's middle module interferes with C-terminal domain (CTD)-dependent RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) binding and with the holoenzyme formation process. A combination of competitive interactions and conformational changes facilitate holoenzyme formation and underlie the mechanism of transcription regulation by Mediator.

In haploid cells, A1p is rapidly degraded via ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis by the proteasome. In diploids, A1p is a homeobox transcription corepressor that forms an extremely stable heterodimer with MATalpha2p that functions to turn off halploid-specific genes, including the Alpha1p mating-type specific co-activator, and allow expression of diploid-specific genes. Both HML and HMR are surrounded by distinct silencer sequences that interact with several factors including the four Sir proteins, silencer binding proteins, histones, Rap1p, and several chromatin modifiers, which create short regions of transcriptionally silent heterochromatin.",22555442,Haber JE (2012) Mating-Type Genes and MAT Switching in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

S000000735,YEL009C,GCN4,General Control Nonderepressible,AAS101 AAS3 ARG9 amino acid starvation-responsive transcription factor GCN4,"GCN4 encodes a conserved eukaryotic basic zipper protein that functions as a global transcription factor of the general amino acid control (GAAC) network required for increased biosynthesis of translation precursors such as ribosomal proteins, amino acids and purines. The GAAC regulatory network is induced not only by amino acid starvation but also by other environmental insults such as glucose limitation, UV radiation, or high salinity stress. GCN4 targets include amino-acid biosynthesis genes and stress response factors, including components of the unfolded protein response, as well as the developmental cell-surface flocculin gene FLO11. Gcn4p activates target genes by direct binding as a homodimer to specific Gcn4-response elements (GCREs) in their promoters (consensus sequence, TGACTCA). GCN4 is regulated at the translational level by a mechanism involving a series of small regulatory upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its 5' UTR. Under normal growth conditions, GCN4 is expressed at a low basal level. Translation is activated in response to starvation for any single amino acid or a defective aminoacyl tRNA synthetase, when most mRNAs experience reduced translation.  Initiation at the GCN4 uORFs inhibits translation of the main GCN4 ORF since a strong termination signal promotes dissociation of the ribosome, and the short distance between the proximal uORF and the GCN4 ORF precludes re-initiation. Amino-acid or carbohydrate limitation both lead to reduced translation initiation, allowing the small ribosomal subunit to scan past the uORFs before associating with the large subunit and initiation factors, leading to increased translation of the main GCN4 ORF. Gcn4p is also subject to a self-controlled feedback circuit between its transcriptional activity and its stability, which depends on the Gcn4p-controlled cyclin PCL5. Increased Gcn4p transcriptional activity increases expression of PCL5, which increases degradation of Gcn4p, resulting in rapid turnover.

The association of a PRE and a TEA/ATTS consensus sequence (TCS; 5'-RCATTCCY-3'), which is recognized by Tec1p, has been designated a filamentous responsive element (FRE) and allows binding of a Ste12p-Tec1p heterodimer to activate expression of genes involved in filamentation. Ste12p-Tec1p heterodimers can also regulate target genes via single TCS elements, with Tec1p providing the DNA binding and Ste12p the transcriptional activation. During vegetative growth, Dig1p and Dig2p directly inhibit the transcriptional activity of Ste12p and of the Ste12p-Tec1p heterodimer. In response to mating pheromone, the inhibitory functions of Dig1p and Dig2p are relieved by phosphorylation through the mating-specific MAPKs Fus3p and Kss1p, allowing the maximal activation of Ste12p target genes, such as the sexual agglutinin genes or FIG2 cell wall adhesin.",23066104,Chan FL and Wong LH (2012) Transcription in the maintenance of centromere chromatin identity.

In the presence of glucose, Mth1p and Std1p are phosphorylated by the protein kinase Yck1p, signaling their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. When Mth1p and Std1p are removed, Rgt1p is a target for phosphorylation by Protein Kinase A via the cAMP/PKA pathway. Phosphorylated Rgt1p is unable to bind DNA and therefore unable to repress transcription. Under high glucose conditions, Rgt1p is hyperphosphorylated, which converts it into a transcriptional activator; it is required under these conditions for full expression of HXT1.",15667318,Johnston M and Kim JH (2005) Glucose as a hormone: receptor-mediated glucose sensing in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Abf1p binding to these sites directly mediates a number of different events in addition to chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation such as DNA replication, silencing, and nucleotide excision repair. Abf1p regulates transcription of over 80 genes involved in a diverse range of cellular processes such as sugar and carbohydrate metabolism (ex.

S000002163,YDL005C,MED2,MEDiator complex,,"MED2 encodes a component of the tail module of the Mediator transcriptional regulation complex.  The Mediator complex is highly conserved from yeast to human, and is a central player in the transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes, being required for nearly all transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Mediator bridges activators and the general transcription machinery. The core Mediator complex contains three distinct head, middle, and tail modules.  Med2p, Nut1p, Pgd1p, Gal11p, and Sin4p are part of the tail module, which has a gene-selective, as opposed to a general, role in transcription, and is largely dedicated to the activation of genes involved in cellular responses to environmental signals.  Med2p, Pgd1p, and Gal11p interact with gene-specific transcriptional activators such as Gcn4p. By interacting with activators, Mediator tail module subunits signal through the head and middle modules, which interact with general transcription factors and RNAPII subunits, to the basal transcription machinery to regulate transcription initiation. The tail module preferentially targets stress-regulated, TATA-containing, SAGA- and Swi/Snf-dependent genes, and may function along with specific chromatin regulators to provide a platform for preinitiation complex (PIC) formation at these highly regulated loci.  Subunits of the Mediator tail module are also required for the activation of metabolic genes.",22771944,Ansari SA and Morse RH (2012) Selective role of Mediator tail module in the transcription of highly regulated genes in yeast.

The activity of Arf1p or Arf2p (ARF) is essential to initiate the formation of COPI vesicles at the Golgi membrane that carry out retrograde transport between the Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum, and within the Golgi compartments. ARF exists in an inactive GDP-bound form in the cytosol and an active GTP-bound form associated with the membranes. The exchange of GDP for GTP on ARF is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) Sec7p, Gea1p, Gea2p, and Syt1p. Activation of ARF triggers a conformational change that exposes its N-terminal domain to be inserted into membranes. Membrane-bound GTP-ARF then stimulates the recruitment of COPI coat proteins (Cop1p, Ret2p, Ret3p, Sec21p, Sec26p, Sec27p) and formation of the COPI vesicle. The subsequent steps of vesicle budding and delivery to its target membrane require inactivation of ARF, i.e. hydrolysis of ARF-bound GTP.

S000002450,YDR043C,NRG1,Negative Regulator of Glucose-repressed genes,transcriptional regulator NRG1,"NRG1 encodes a transcriptional repressor that is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger class. Nrg1p, along with its paralog Nrg2p, responds to glucose signals received via Snf1p kinase, and to stress signals received via the Rim101p transcriptional repressor. Nrg1p and Nrg2p regulate a variety of processes, including response to glucose levels; response to alkaline pH and to salt, osmotic, and oxidative stress; filamentous growth; and biofilm formation. Some major targets of Nrg1p and Nrg2p include FLO11, encoding a cell surface adhesin, ENA1, encoding a plasma membrane salt efflux pump, and SUC2, encoding extracellular invertase. The set of genes regulated by Nrg1p overlaps with, but is not identical to, the set regulated by Nrg2p. Some targets repressed by Nrg1p but apparently not by Nrg2p include RSB1, encoding a lipid translocase that regulates plasma membrane lipid composition, and DIT1, encoding an enzyme required for spore wall maturation.

Gis1p additionally activates transcription of some sporulation-specific genes, such as DIT1 and SPS100. Gis1p binds to postdiauxic shift (PDS) elements in the promoters of its target genes. GIS1 is a regulatory target of the Protein Kinase A (PKA), Sch9, and TORC1 pathways that sense nutrient availability. Gis1p is activated via phosphorylation by the Rim15p kinase, and is downregulated via dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A in complex with its regulatory subunit Cdc55p. Additionally, Gis1p is subject to proteasome-mediated degradation upon resumption of growth after stationary phase. In addition to its role as a transcription factor, Gis1p may function as a histone demethylase: it has JmjN and JmjC domains, which are suggestive of histone demethylase activity. However, it carries a mutation in a conserved residue of the JmjC domain and there is controversy over whether it is functional as a histone demethylase. RPH1, the paralog of GIS1, encodes a transcription factor with confirmed histone demethylase activity.",22363679,"Orzechowski Westholm J, et al.

S000002631,YDR223W,CRF1,Co-Repressor with FHL1,,"CRF1 encodes a transcription corepressor that regulates genes involved in growth and metabolism.  The complex of Crf1p with the forkhead domain transcription factor Fhl1p represses transcription of ribosomal protein-encoding genes under conditions of nutrient deficiency. Crf1p binding to Fhl1p is mutually exclusive with binding of the Crf1p paralog Ifh1p, which acts as a transcriptional coactivator for Fhl1p. Crl1p activity is regulated via its localization to the nucleus or cytoplasm. When nutrients are abundant, TORC1 inhibits the Yak1p kinase via regulation of protein kinase A (PKA). Inhibition of Yak1p activity causes Crf1p to become dephosphorylated and exit the nucleus, relieving repression of the ribosomal protein genes and allowing Ifh1p to bind Fhl1p and activate transcription. When nutrients are scarce, or when TORC1 is inhibited with rapamycin, TORC1 does not inhibit Yak1p and Crf1p becomes phosphorylated. The phosphorylated form is able to accumulate in the nucleus, where it binds to Fhl1p and represses ribosomal protein gene transcription. Interestingly, this mechanism appears not to occur in the common lab strain background W303: the crf1 null mutation in W303 has no phenotype, and Crf1p cannot be detected at promoters.

Met4p-dependent promoters have been identified in 45 genes, and each contains a Met31p/Met32p-binding site. The association of Met31p/Met32p with their binding sites in MET promoters provides a platform for recruiting and interacting with Met4p.

This heterodimer has an extended structure with a four-helix bundle domain and a coiled-coil protrusion connected by a flexible hinge. Within the core Mediator complex, Srb7p forms a bridge to the head module through binding head component Med6p. The flexible bridge and hinge structure allows for changes in overall Mediator structure upon binding to RNAPII or other factors. General repressor Tup1p competes with Med6p for binding to Srb7p, and this interaction is essential for repressive function of Tup1p.",15710619,

The Mediator complex is highly conserved from yeast to human, and is a central player in the transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes, being required for nearly all transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Mediator bridges activators and the general transcription machinery. The core Mediator complex contains three distinct head, middle, and tail modules. The CKM is a dissociable subcomplex that represses basal transcription.  The other three subunits of the CKM are encoded by SSN3/CDK8/SRB10, SSN8/SRB11, and SSN5/MED12/SRB8. the strongest Mediator-CKM interaction involved a discrete contact through subunit Ssn2p. Formation of a Mediator-RNAPII holoenzyme is largely blocked by association of the CKM with the core Mediator complex. Interaction of the CKM with Mediator's middle module interferes with C-terminal domain (CTD)-dependent RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) binding and with the holoenzyme formation process. A combination of competitive interactions and conformational changes facilitate holoenzyme formation and underlie the mechanism of transcription regulation by Mediator.

S000002993,YGL025C,PGD1,PolyGlutamine Domain,HRS1 MED3,"PGD1 (also called MED3) encodes a component of the tail module of the Mediator transcriptional regulation complex.  The Mediator complex is highly conserved from yeast to human, and is a central player in the transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes, being required for nearly all transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Mediator bridges activators and the general transcription machinery. The core Mediator complex contains three distinct head, middle, and tail modules.  Pgd1p, Med2p, Nut1p, Gal11p, and Sin4p are part of the tail module, which has a gene-selective, as opposed to a general, role in transcription, and is largely dedicated to the activation of genes involved in cellular responses to environmental signals.  Pgd1p, Med2p, and Gal11p interact with gene-specific transcriptional activators such as Gcn4p. By interacting with activators, Mediator tail module subunits signal through the head and middle modules, which interact with general transcription factors and RNAPII subunits, to the basal transcription machinery to regulate transcription initiation. The tail module preferentially targets stress-regulated, TATA-containing, SAGA- and Swi/Snf-dependent genes, and may function along with specific chromatin regulators to provide a platform for preinitiation complex (PIC) formation at these highly regulated loci.  Subunits of the Mediator tail module are also required for the activation of metabolic genes.",22771944,Ansari SA and Morse RH (2012) Selective role of Mediator tail module in the transcription of highly regulated genes in yeast.

The lipid component that anchors the LLO in the ER membrane is dolichol (Dol), a polyisoprenoid molecule composed in yeast of 15-16 isoprene units. The LLO assembly involves sequential additions of two N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), nine mannose (Man), and three glucose (Glc) residues. Alg13p forms a complex with its anchoring subunit Alg14p and catalyzes the second step in this process, the addition of the second GlcNAc moiety to Dol-PP-GlcNAc, the product of an earlier reaction catalyzed by UDP-GlcNAc transferase Alg7p. The subsequent steps involve the addition of one Man molecule by Alg1p, two branching Man molecules by an alpha-1,3- and alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase Alg2p, followed by two consecutive additions of Man by an alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase Alg11p. All these steps take place on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane and the product, Dol-PP-GlcNAc2-Man5, is then flipped to the ER lumen by an unknown flippase.

S000003015,YGL047W,ALG13,Asparagine-Linked Glycosylation,N-acetylglucosaminyldiphosphodolichol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase catalytic subunit ALG13,"ALG13 encodes a catalytic subunit of a UDP-GlcNAc transferase involved in the first step of N-linked glycosylation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) - the assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO), which then serves as a donor in the second step - the transfer of the oligosaccharide to asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides. The lipid component that anchors the LLO in the ER membrane is dolichol (Dol), a polyisoprenoid molecule composed in yeast of 15-16 isoprene units. The LLO assembly involves sequential additions of two N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), nine mannose (Man), and three glucose (Glc) residues. Alg13p forms a complex with its anchoring subunit Alg14p and catalyzes the second step in this process, the addition of the second GlcNAc moiety to Dol-PP-GlcNAc, the product of an earlier reaction catalyzed by UDP-GlcNAc transferase Alg7p. The subsequent steps involve the addition of one Man molecule by Alg1p, two branching Man molecules by an alpha-1,3- and alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase Alg2p, followed by two consecutive additions of Man by an alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase Alg11p. All these steps take place on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane and the product, Dol-PP-GlcNAc2-Man5, is then flipped to the ER lumen by an unknown flippase. In the ER lumen, the oligosaccharide chain is elongated by four more Man residues, catalyzed by mannosyltransferases Alg3p, Alg12p and Alg9p, and three Glc residues, catalyzed by glucosyltransferases Alg6p, Alg8p and Alg10p. The final product delivers the 14 glycan molecule to the hetero-oligomeric oligosaccharyltransferase (Ost) complex (Ost1p, Ost2p, Ost3p, Ost4p, Ost5p, Ost6p, Stt3p, Swp1p, and Wbp1p), which transfers the entire oligosaccharide chain to asparagine side chains in polypeptides. The entire process that leads to the assembly of the LLO must be strictly ordered and the order appears to be ensured by high substrate specificities of all the participating ALG enzymes.

Hsf1p contains a DNA-binding domain, three leucine zipper repeats responsible for Hsf1p trimerization, a C-terminal transactivation domain, and an N-terminal transactivation domain. All Hsf1p target gene promoters contain multiples of the pentameric sequence 5'-NGAAN-3', termed heat shock elements (HSEs). Hsf1p recognizes both continuous and discontinuous repeats of HSEs.  The active DNA-binding form of Hsf1p is a homotrimer.  While each HSE is a recognition site for a single Hsf1p monomer, a minimum of three pentameric units is required for stable binding. Some target genes contain four to six contiguous HSEs that are bound by two Hsf1p homotrimers, or seven to eight units that may recruit up to three colocalized homotrimers. However, a single Hsf1p trimer is sufficient to activate transcription. Hsf1p is constitutively bound on target promoters as a homotrimer even in the absence of stress, and its activation function is modulated at the post-translational level.

S000003592,YJL056C,ZAP1,Zinc-responsive Activator Protein,ZRG10,"ZAP1 encodes a zinc-sensing transcription factor that regulates the cellular response to zinc deficiency. Under zinc depletion, Zap1p activates transcription of ~80 genes, and represses expression of a small number of genes. Zap1p target genes are involved in zinc homeostasis and metabolic adaptation to zinc deficiency. Zap1p is inactivated when zinc is in abundance. Zap1p contains a DNA-binding domain and multiple transcription activation domains, all of which bind zinc. The DNA binding domain is located toward the C-terminus and consists of five C2H2 zinc fingers. In zinc-deficient cells, Zap1p binds as a monomer to a palindromic zinc-responsive element (ZRE), 5'-ACCTTNAAGGT-3'. Zap1p-regulated promoters typically contain one or a few recognizable ZREs. The ZAP1 gene contains a ZRE and is activated by Zap1p, thereby increasing the amount of cellular Zap1p during zinc limitation. ZREs with the highest binding affinity for Zap1p tend to appear in genes activated by mild iron deficiency, which suggests that Zap1p occupies lower-affinity sites only when the Zap1p levels rise, as they do in severe zinc deficiency. Zap1p regulates expression of zinc transporters that transfer extracellular zinc into the cell and the vacuolar zinc to the cytosol. Zrt1p and Zrt2p are high- and low-affinity zinc transporters of the ZIP family. ZRT2 is repressed by Zap1p under conditions of severe zinc limitation. This repression is mediated through a lower-affinity ZRE in the ZRT2 promoter. Activation of ZRT2 is mediated by Zap1p binding to high-affinity ZREs located upstream of the TATA box. Severe zinc deficiency increases the levels of Zap1p through autoactivation of its own promoter. Zap1p can then also bind to a lower affinity ZRE located near the transcription start site of ZRT2, inhibiting transcription. Under conditions where zinc levels are too low for ZRT2 to function, expression is repressed. In zinc-replete conditions, zinc storage is mediated by two transporters on the vacuolar membrane, Cot1p and Zrc1p. Under conditions of zinc deficiency, vacuolar zinc stores are mobilized through the activity of Zrt3p, a ZIP family transporter on the vacuolar membrane. ZRC1 is also induced by Zap1p during zinc deficiency as a protective measure for cells exposed to sudden influx of zinc produced by expression of uptake systems at high levels. Fet4p is a low-affinity, broad-specificity metal transporter, the expression of which is induced by Zap1p under zinc-limiting conditions. Zrg17p, part of a heterodimeric transporter with Msc2p that transfers zinc from the cytosol to the ER lumen, and member of the cation diffusion facilitator family of efflux pumps, is also zinc-regulated directly through Zap1p.",23463800,Cyert MS and Philpott CC (2013) Regulation of cation balance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

S000004121,YLR131C,ACE2,Activator of CUP1 Expression,DNA-binding transcription factor ACE2,"ACE2 encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the C2H2 zinc finger class. At the end of mitosis, Ace2p acts specifically in daughter cells to activate transcription of genes such as CTS1, SCW11, DSE2, DSE3, and DSE4, encoding chitinases and glucanases that are required to destroy the septum and allow mother and daughter cells to separate after budding. It also activates expression of BUD9 and DSE1, both involved in bud site selection. Ace2p also represses transcription of the G1 cyclin Cln3p, causing daughter cells to have a lengthened G1 period to allow sufficient growth before budding. Ace2p activity is regulated by its nuclear localization, which in turn is controlled by phosphorylation. During anaphase and early telophase, phosphorylation of the nuclear localization sites of Ace2p, mediated by mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase, prevents Ace2p from entering the nucleus. In late telophase, these sites are dephosphorylated by Cdc14p, allowing Ace2p to enter both mother and daughter nuclei. Its nuclear export sequence (NES) is then phosphorylated by Cbk1p specifically in daughter cell nuclei, causing Ace2p to accumulate there. Phosphorylation by Cbk1p at an additional site increases transcription activation by Ace2p. Later in G1, the NES of Ace2p is dephosphorylated, allowing Ace2p to exit the nucleus, after which it is sequestered in the cytoplasm. Ace2p has a paralog, Swi5p, which also acts at the end of mitosis but regulates a distinct set of genes.",23212898,Weiss EL (2012) Mitotic exit and separation of mother and daughter cells.

With Swi4p, Swi6p forms the SBF (Swi4p/Swi6p cell-cycle box (SCB) binding factor) complex, whose targets include G1 cyclins (CLN1, CLN2, PCL1, PCL2) and the HO endonuclease. With Mbp1p, Swi6p forms the MBF (Mlu1 cell cycle box (MCB) Binding Factor) complex. MBF targets partially overlap with those of SBF, and include genes involved in DNA synthesis and DNA repair (for example, CDC21, CDC8, and CDC9, and G1 cyclins, as well as SWI4). SBF and MBF both repress G1/S genes during early G1 phase. Whi5p binding to the SBF complex in early G1 causes SBF to repress transcription. After phosphorylation of Whi5p by Cdc28p/Cln3p it dissociates from SBF, allowing SBF to activate transcription. Cdc28p/Cln3p also activates MBF-regulated promoters. Transcription of the CLN1 and CLN2 genes by SBF feeds back to further activate both SBF- and MBF-regulated promoters. Swi6p and SBF are also involved in chromatin reorganization at certain promoters such as CLN2 and HO via recruitment of the FACT complex.

Aco1p localizes to mitochondrial matrix and it is also found in association with protein-DNA complexes called nucleoids that are responsible for packaging of mtDNA.

Msn2p and Msn4p regulate the expression of ~200 genes in response to several stresses, including heat shock, osmotic shock, oxidative stress, low pH, glucose starvation, sorbic acid and high ethanol concentrations, by binding to the stress response element (STRE), 5'-CCCCT-3', located in their promoters.

Upon stress, Msn2/4p are hyperphosphorylated, relocalized to the nucleus and then display a periodic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling behavior. Nuclear export of Msn2p is dependent on the exportin Msn5p and nuclear localization at both the import and export level is regulated by PKA. Msn2p is also positively regulated by the Psr1p/Whi2p phosphatase complex and negatively regulated by Snf1p phosphorylation and by its degradation in the nucleus, a process dependent on the cyclin-dependent kinase Ssn3p.",16489456,"Boy-Marcotte E, et al.

The Mediator complex is highly conserved from yeast to human, and is a central player in the transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes, being required for nearly all transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Mediator bridges activators and the general transcription machinery. The core Mediator complex contains three distinct head, middle, and tail modules.  Other subunits of the head module are encoded by MED6, MED8, SRB2/MED20, SRB4/MED17, SRB5/MED18, SRB6/MED22, and ROX3/MED19. The head module binds weakly to a minimal preinitiation complex (PIC) consisting of RNAPII, general initiation factors TFIIF, TFIIB and TBP, and promoter DNA to stimulate basal transcription. Mediator interacts physically with diverse DNA-binding transactivators to communicate transcription signals to RNAPII and general initiation factors to turn transcription on or off. Mediator also has important functions in post-initiation steps, such as recruiting and coordinating the activities of RNAPII elongation factors.",22084422,

There are four other known ACSs in yeast, Faa1p, Faa2p, Faa3p and Fat1p, that differ in substrate specificity and subcellular localization. Faa4p shares substrate specificity for long chain (C12:0-C16:0) fatty acids and subcellular localization (ER, lipid droplets) with Faa1p, which is the major ACS that provides over 90% of the activity under standard growth conditions. Both Faa1p and Faa4p are believed to have partially overlapping cellular roles. Under anaerobic conditions, or in mutants defective in fatty acid synthesis, FAA1 and FAA4 become essential for growth due to their involvement in the uptake of exogenous fatty acids. This fatty acid import, called vectorial acylation, is known to require Fat1p and either Faa1p or Faa4p. By their impact on fatty acid import, Faa1p and Faa4p affect fatty acid-dependent transcriptional regulation of multiple genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and/or desaturation that are under control of transcription factors Mga2p/Spt23p and Oaf1p/Pip2p, respectively. Specific mechanisms of this regulatory circuit(s) remain to be uncovered. Expression of FAA1 remains steady during logarithmic growth but it increases significantly under heat shock or when cells enter stationary phase.

The Mediator complex is highly conserved from yeast to human, and is a central player in the transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes, being required for nearly all transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Mediator bridges activators and the general transcription machinery. The core Mediator complex contains three distinct head, middle, and tail modules. The CKM is a dissociable subcomplex that represses basal transcription.  The other three subunits of the CKM are encoded by SSN3/CDK8/SRB10, SSN5/MED12/SRB8, and SSN2/MED13/SRB9. Formation of a Mediator-RNAPII holoenzyme is largely blocked by association of the CKM with the core Mediator complex. Interaction of the CKM with Mediator's middle module interferes with C-terminal domain (CTD)-dependent RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) binding and with the holoenzyme formation process. A combination of competitive interactions and conformational changes facilitate holoenzyme formation and underlie the mechanism of transcription regulation by Mediator. Obstruction of CTD-dependent RNAPII interaction with the middle module explains the repressive effect of the CKM on transcription.",23563140,"Tsai KL, et al.

The Mediator complex is highly conserved from yeast to human, and is a central player in the transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes, being required for nearly all transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Mediator bridges activators and the general transcription machinery. The core Mediator complex contains three distinct head, middle, and tail modules.  Sin4p, Nut1p, Pgd1p, Med2p, and Gal11p are part of the tail module, which has a gene-selective, as opposed to a general, role in transcription, and is largely dedicated to the activation of genes involved in cellular responses to environmental signals.  Pgd1p, Med2p, and Gal11p interact with gene-specific transcriptional activators such as Gcn4p. By interacting with activators, Mediator tail module subunits signal through the head and middle modules, which interact with general transcription factors and RNAPII subunits, to the basal transcription machinery to regulate transcription initiation. The tail module preferentially targets stress-regulated, TATA-containing, SAGA- and Swi/Snf-dependent genes, and may function along with specific chromatin regulators to provide a platform for preinitiation complex (PIC) formation at these highly regulated loci.  Subunits of the Mediator tail module are also required for the activation of metabolic genes.",22771944,Ansari SA and Morse RH (2012) Selective role of Mediator tail module in the transcription of highly regulated genes in yeast.

SBF is a heterodimeric DNA-binding factor composed of Swi4p and Swi6p that participates in a positive feedback loop that important for producing the burst of cyclins that accompanies START. MBF is a heterodimeric DNA-binding factor composed of Mbp1p and Swi6p that promotes expression of other G1/S genes. Stb1p interacts with SBF and MBF, and binds SBF- and MBF-specific promoters during G1 phase. Stb1p functions in both transcriptional repression and activation. Stb1p serves as an intermediary between the SBF transcription complex and the Rpd3L histone deacetylase complex, and allows SBF to recruit Rpd3L to promoters. Stb1p inhibits SBF activity during early G1, until it becomes phosphorylated by CDK which ends the inhibition and allows SBF to activate transcription.

The Mediator complex is highly conserved from yeast to human, and is a central player in the transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes, being required for nearly all transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Mediator bridges activators and the general transcription machinery. The core Mediator complex contains three distinct head, middle, and tail modules.  Gal11p, Nut1p, Pgd1p, Med2p, and Sin4p are part of the tail module, which has a gene-selective, as opposed to a general, role in transcription, and is largely dedicated to the activation of genes involved in cellular responses to environmental signals. By interacting with activators, Mediator tail module subunits signal through the head and middle modules, which interact with general transcription factors and RNAPII subunits, to the basal transcription machinery to regulate transcription initiation. The tail module preferentially targets stress-regulated, TATA-containing, SAGA- and Swi/Snf-dependent genes, and may function along with specific chromatin regulators to provide a platform for preinitiation complex (PIC) formation at these highly regulated loci.  Subunits of the Mediator tail module are also required for the activation of metabolic genes. Oleate-activated transcription factor Oaf1p interacts directly with Gal11p through the conserved KIX domain to regulate fatty acid metabolism.  Gal11p regulates galactose and amino acid metabolism by directly interacting with transcriptional activators Gal4p and Gcn4p.

S000005428,YOL067C,RTG1,ReTroGrade regulation,,"RTG1 and RTG3 encode positive regulators of the retrograde (RTG) regulatory pathway, which responds to mitochondrial dysfunction and to growth on nitrogen sources requiring alpha-ketoglutarate for nitrogen assimilation.  The RTG pathway provides for ammonium assimilation from poor nitrogen sources and a source of glutamate in the absence of mitochondrial function. Rtg1p and Rtg3p form a heterodimeric transcriptional activator whose nuclear localization is regulated in response to mitochondrial integrity and nitrogen availability. When nitrogen is available and mitochondria are functional, Rtg1p/Rtg3p resides in the cytoplasm. Reduction in mitochondrial function or depletion of nitrogen results in nuclear localization of Rtg1p/Rtg3p and subsequent activation of target genes. Regulation of the nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of Rtg1p/Rtg3p involves Mks1p, Rtg2p, and Bmh1p/Bmh2p. When phosphorylated, Mks1p forms an anchor complex with Bmh1p/Bmh2p that keeps Rtg1p/Rtg3p in the cytoplasm. Rtg2p regulates the subcellular location of the Rtg1p/Rtg3p heterodimer, and can relieve its cytoplasmic sequestration by competing for Bmh1p/Bmh2p binding to Mks1p.",22964838,Broach JR (2012) Nutritional control of growth and development in yeast.

Other members of Paf1C include Cdc73p, Leo1p, Paf1p, and Rtf1p. Paf1C is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes and participates in multiple aspects of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcriptional regulation.  Paf1c promotes RNAPII transcription elongation and transcription-coupled histone modifications, thereby affecting various cellular processes such as gene expression, silencing, RNA maturation, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression. Ctr9p is the largest subunit of Paf1p, and contains a series of eight tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. Ctr9p is also needed for trimethylation of histone H3K36 by the Set2p methyltransferase, affecting histone acetylation levels.

S000005505,YOL145C,CTR9,Cln Three (CLN3) Requiring,CDP1,"CTR9 encodes a component of the Polymerase-Associated Factor 1 (Paf1) complex (Paf1C). Other members of Paf1C include Cdc73p, Leo1p, Paf1p, and Rtf1p. Paf1C is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes and participates in multiple aspects of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcriptional regulation.  Paf1c promotes RNAPII transcription elongation and transcription-coupled histone modifications, thereby affecting various cellular processes such as gene expression, silencing, RNA maturation, DNA repair, and cell cycle progression. Ctr9p is the largest subunit of Paf1p, and contains a series of eight tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs. Ctr9p is also needed for trimethylation of histone H3K36 by the Set2p methyltransferase, affecting histone acetylation levels.

After the product, Dol-PP-GlcNAc2-Man5, is flipped to the ER lumen by an unknown flippase, the oligosaccharide chain is elongated by four more Man residues, in reactions catalyzed by mannosyltransferases Alg3p, Alg12p and Alg9p, and three Glc residues, catalyzed by glucosyltransferases Alg6p, Alg8p and Alg10p. The final product delivers the 14 glycan molecule to the hetero-oligomeric oligosaccharyltransferase (Ost) complex (Ost1p, Ost2p, Ost3p, Ost4p, Ost5p, Ost6p, Stt3p, Swp1p, and Wbp1p), which transfers the entire oligosaccharide chain to asparagine side chains in polypeptides. The entire process that leads to the assembly of the LLO must be strictly ordered and the order appears to be ensured by high substrate specificities of all the participating ALG enzymes. The regulation of the activities appears to occur at the level of substrate availability, and the rate-limiting factor may be the amount of Dol-P on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane, which seems to be primarily affected by recycling of Dol-PP released by the Ost complex. The initial steps of protein N-glycosylation are remarkably conserved in evolution and most of the yeast genes involved in this process have their known homologs in humans, many of which are implicated in severe disorders such as the CDG syndrome (congenital disorders of glycosylation) as well as congenital muscular dystrophies.",23135325,

During the early G1 phase, Whi5p inhibits transcription of genes required for cell cycle progression into the S phase by binding to the transcriptional activator Swi4p-Swi6p complex (SBF) at target promoters. At the onset of G1/S transition, Whi5p is phosphorylated by the CDK-Cyclin complex, Cdc28p-Cln3p, which triggers its dissociation from SBF and exit from nucleus. Subsequent weak activation of transcription results in accumulation of cyclins Cln1p and Cln2p that in turn stimulate Cdc28p to further phosphorylate and inactivate Whi5p. Removal of Whi5p inhibition allows transcriptional activators SBF and MBF (Mbp1p-Swi6p) to activate transcription of over 200 genes that contain SCB (Swi4/6-dependent cell cycle box) or MCB (Mlu1 cell cycle box) regulatory elements in their promoters. Among those genes are the S-phase cyclins that initiate DNA synthesis.

The Mediator complex is highly conserved from yeast to human, and is a central player in the transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes, being required for nearly all transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Mediator bridges activators and the general transcription machinery. The core Mediator complex contains three distinct head, middle, and tail modules.  Other subunits of the  middle module are encoded by MED1, MED7, NUT2/MED10, CSE2/MED9, RGR1/MED14, SOH1/MED31, and SRB7/MED21. The tail module interacts with gene expression regulators, while the head and middle modules interact with general transcription factors and RNAPII subunits to regulate transcription initiation.

The Mediator complex is highly conserved from yeast to human, and is a central player in the transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes, being required for nearly all transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Mediator bridges activators and the general transcription machinery. The core Mediator complex contains three distinct head, middle, and tail modules. The CKM is a dissociable subcomplex that represses basal transcription.  The other three subunits of the CKM are encoded by SSN5/MED12/SRB8, SSN8/SRB11, and SSN2/MED13/SRB9. Formation of a Mediator-RNAPII holoenzyme is largely blocked by association of the CKM with the core Mediator complex. Interaction of the CKM with Mediator's middle module interferes with C-terminal domain (CTD)-dependent RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) binding and with the holoenzyme formation process.

The activities of Aft1p and Aft2p are regulated by monothiol glutaredoxins Grx3p and Grx4p, and exportin Msn5p. Aft1p cycles between the nucleus and cytosol, favoring cytosolic localization under iron-replete conditions, which induce multimerization of Aft1p/2p and favor export from the nucleus via interaction with the exportin Msn5p. Under low-iron conditions, Aft1p and Aft2p accumulates in the nucleus where it binds to and activates genes involved in iron uptake, transport, and storage, known collectively as the iron regulon.",17074835,"Pujol-Carrion N, et al.

The product of this reaction, Dol-P-Glc, is utilized during the first stage of N-linked glycosylation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) - the assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO). The LLO then serves as a donor in the second stage - the transfer of the assembled oligosaccharide to asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides. The lipid component that anchors the LLO in the ER membrane is dolichol (Dol), a polyisoprenoid molecule composed in yeast of 15-16 isoprene units. The LLO assembly involves sequential additions of two N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), nine mannose (Man), and three glucose (Glc) molecules. The last three reactions, catalyzed by glucosyltransferases Alg6p, Alg8p and Alg10p, require Dol-P-Glc as a donor of Glc and, therefore, depend on the Alg5p activity. The reaction catalyzed by Alg5p takes place on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane and the product, Dol-P-Glc, has to be translocated to the lumenal side, where the late steps of the LLO assembly are known to occur, but the protein(s) responsible for this translocation have not been identified. The assembled LLO delivers the 14 glycan molecule to the hetero-oligomeric oligosaccharyltransferase (Ost) complex (Ost1p, Ost2p, Ost3p, Ost4p, Ost5p, Ost6p, Stt3p, Swp1p, and Wbp1p), which transfers the entire oligosaccharide chain to asparagine side chains in polypeptides. The entire process that leads to the assembly of the LLO must be strictly ordered and the order appears to be ensured by high substrate specificities of all the ALG enzymes involved. The regulation of the activities appears to occur at the level of substrate availability, and the rate-limiting factor may be the amount of Dol-P on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane, which seems to be primarily affected by recycling of Dol-PP released by the Ost complex.

S000006225,YPR021C,AGC1,Aspartate-Glutamate Carrier,amino acid transporter AGC1,"AGC1 encodes a mitochondrial amino acid transporter that plays a dual role in mitochondrial metabolism. As a glutamate uniporter Agc1p supplies the mitochondria with glutamate, which is a substrate for nitrogen metabolism, in particular the biosynthesis of ornithine. As an aspartate-glutamate exchanger Agc1p plays a key role in the malate-aspartate redox shuttle, which is an NADH shuttle transporting reducing equivalents from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix and is essential for utilization of acetate or fatty acids as carbon sources. The regulation of the two functions of Agc1p is not known. There are two human orthologs, aralar1 and citrin, encoded by SLC25A12 and SLC25A13, respectively, which contain N-terminal EF-hand calcium-binding motifs and are known to be regulated by calcium. Agc1p has a 600 amino acid long extension at its N-terminus, but it does not have any discernible calcium-responsive motifs.

The Nhp6A and Nhp6B proteins differ at their N-termini, but over the 90 amino acid core region are 96% similar. Nhp6p contains a single HMGB domain that binds DNA in the minor groove and a basic N-terminal extension that wraps around DNA to contact the major groove, enabling Nhp6p to bind DNA as a monomer in a sequence-nonspecific manner, and bend DNA sharply. Nhp6p affects a range of processes linked to appropriate regulation of transcription through maintenance of normal chromatin structure. Nhp6p functions in the formation of preinitiation complexes at RNA polymerase II promoters, and also promotes RNA polymerase III transcription, as well as facilitating the activity of chromatin modifying complexes. Nhp6p localization in the vicinity of transcription start sites parallels that of nucleosomes. Expression of NHP6 genes is regulated by the concentration of Nhp6 protein or RNA, as overexpression of Nhp6p results in a dramatic decrease in NHP6 expression, and is toxic to cells.",20123079,Stillman DJ (2010) Nhp6: A small but powerful effector of chromatin structure in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

TFIIB and other general transcription factors assemble with RNAPII and promoter DNA in a large complex at every round of transcription initiation. TFIIB and the TATA-binding protein (TBP) subunit of TFIID are primarily responsible for promoter recognition. TFIIB has been implicated in both start site selection and in stabilization of the initial transcript. The N-terminus of TFIIB includes a zinc ribbon domain which contacts the dock domain of RNAPII, and a loop termed the B finger that reaches into the active center of the RNAPII and interacts with both DNA and RNA. The C-terminus of TFIIB, which contains a series of cyclin repeats that make up the C-terminal core, locates above the RNAPII active center cleft. The central linker region of TFIIB snakes down from above the cleft toward the active center, past loops of Rpo21p and Rpb2p, and the Rpo21p clamp, contributing to stabilization of those structures. DNA follows a path above the RNAPII central cleft leading to the RNAPII active center. TFIIB and RNAPII form a template-strand tunnel which promotes transient and progressive promoter melting, contributing to the closed-to-open promoter transition, and maintaining the transcription bubble until the DNA-RNA hybrid is long enough to persist on its own. TFIIB may also serve as a scaffold for binding other transcription factors.",19965383,"Liu X, et al. (2010) Structure of an RNA polymerase II-TFIIB complex and the transcription initiation mechanism.

S000006337,YPR133C,SPN1,Suppresses Postrecruitment functions gene Number 1,IWS1,"SPN1 encodes a highly-conserved chromatin-associated transcription factor with a conserved central domain composed of eight alpha-helices similar in structure to TFIIS. Spn1p occupies poised promoters in the uninduced state, along with RNA polymerase II. Histone chaperone Spt6p and the Swi/Snf complex are recruited upon activation. Spt6p promotes reassembly of nucleosomes following passage of RNA polymerase II. By interacting with both RNA polymerase II and Spt6p, Spn1p links the regulation of the poised promoter to chromatin architecture, and is an important regulator of the Spt6-nucleosome interaction. Binding of Spn1p at poised promoters blocks the recruitment of the Swi/Snf complex in the uninduced state and serves as a platform for the recruitment of Spt6p during the activated state. Spn1p and Spt6p have also been implicated in mRNA processing.",20875428,

Arr1p is the master regulator of the arsenic stress response, mediating transcriptional activation of the ARR2 arsenate reductase and the ARR3 plasma membrane arsenite antiporter, thereby facilitating extrusion of arsenite molecules from the cytoplasm. The activity of Arr1p is primarily regulated at the level of its export from the nucleus. Under normal conditions Arr1p is freely distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus, but mostly it is localized in the cytosol due to its active export from the nucleus by Crm1p, which binds a nuclear export signal (NES) in the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (n-CRD) of Arr1p. Arr1p is activated by arsenite, which modifies the sulfhydryl groups of specific cysteines, masking the NES and abolishing its recognition by Crm1p.",20148391,"Rodrigues-Pousada C, et al.
