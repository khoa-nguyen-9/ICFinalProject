		{"body" : "MET28, a member of the basic leucine zipper DNA binding factor family, encodes a transcription factor that participates in the regulation of sulfur metabolism (1). Transcriptional activation of the MET gene network, which includes MET28, requires at least five positive trans-acting factors: Cbf1p, Met4p, Met28p, Met31p, and Met32p (2, 3). Of these five factors, Met4p is the only one endowed with transcription activation function, while the other four act by promoting the recruitment of Met4p to the DNA (1, 4, 5, 6, 3). Cbf1p, Met4p, and Met28p form a heteromeric complex that binds to the 5'-TCACGTG-3' motif found in the 5' upstream regions of the structural and regulatory genes of the sulfur network (1, 4, 2, 6). The leucine zippers of Met4p and Met28p, along with the basic helix-loop-helix domain of Met28p, provide the protein surfaces mediating these interactions (1, 2, 3). Within the complex, Met4p is responsible for transcriptional activation, and Cbf1p is required for DNA recognition and binding. Met28p regulates the formation of the complex, and functions by stimulating the DNA-binding activity of Cbf1p (4, 2). Both Met4p and Met28p bind to DNA only in the presence of Cbf1p, and the presence of Cbf1p and Met4p stimulates the binding of Met28p to DNA (1, 2). As for the structural genes involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism, the transcription of MET28 is repressed by increases in the intracellular concentration of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the end product of the sulfur amino acid biosynthesis pathway (2). Transcription of MET28 also strictly depends on Met4p, which is recruited to the promoter region of MET28 through its association with Met28p and either Met31p or Met32p in high molecular weight complexes (6, 3). Both Met31p and Met32p bind to the 5'-AAACTGTGG-3' sequence, which is present at position -145 upstream of MET28 (6). Met28p may be required to stabilize the interaction established between Met4p and both Met31p and Met32p, but it is not essential for such protein-protein interactions (6). Taken together, the dual functions of Met28p and the mechanism underlying the regulation of MET28 reveal the existence of a positive regulatory loop within the sulfur network (5). This loop is expected to increase dynamically the response of the sulfur network when the intracellular concentration of AdoMet is low."
},{"body" : "REG2 encodes a regulatory subunit of the Glc7p type-1 protein phosphatase (PP1) (3). Reg2p, and the similar protein Reg1p, are each involved in targeting Glc7p to substrates that are phosphorylated by the Snf1p kinase (1). Glc7p-Reg2p and Glc7p-Reg1p are also involved in the glucose-induced proteolysis of maltose permease (Mal11p, Mal21p, Mal31p, Mal41p and Mal61p) (3). Glucose repression of REG2 is partially dependent on Mig1p and Mig2p (4), and induction of REG2 expression during the diauxic shift is dependent on Cat8p (5). REG2 is not essential for viability (1), but reg2 null mutants display reduced rates of both glucose-induced proteolysis of maltose permease and inactivation of maltose transport (3), as well as reduced expression of PIS1 and INO1 during growth on glucose (6). reg1 reg2 double null mutants exhibit a severe growth defect as compared to either wild type or reg1 null mutants (1). Overexpression of REG2 complements the slow-growth defect of a reg1 mutant (1), but does not complement defects in glycogen accumulation or glucose repression displayed by reg1 nulls (1). Overexpression of REG2 in a reg1 null mutant does restore the glucose-induced proteolysis of maltose permease and partially reinstates the inactivated maltose transport, but does not affect the insensitivity of MAL gene expression to repression by glucose"
},{"body" : "PHO5 encodes the major phosphate-regulated secreted acid phosphatase in budding yeast (5, 3). It is highly expressed under low-phosphate conditions and repressed when phosphate is abundant. There are two similarly regulated phosphatases, Pho10p and Pho11p, that supply less than 10% of secreted acid phosphatase activity when cells are starved for phosphate (6). One other acid phosphatase, Pho3p, is regulated in the opposite manner, being induced under high-phosphate conditions (7). The acid phosphatases are secreted from the cell and are predominantly found in the periplasmic space (7). Phosphatases and phosphate transporters such as Pho84p help maintain the appropriate level of bioavailable phosphate in the cell. PHO5 regulation has been extensively researched (5). Under high-phosphate conditions, PHO5 is inactive and its promoter is protected by four positioned nucleosomes (6, 7). When phosphate is depleted, Pho4p, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, and Pho2p, a homeodomain protein, act cooperatively to bind the PHO5 promoter and activate PHO5 transcription (4, 3). Pho4p activity is regulated by the Pho80p(cyclin)/Pho85p(cyclin-dependent kinase) complex, which is in turn regulated by Pho81p, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (8, 9)."
},{"body" : "PHO2, also known as BAS2 or GRF10, encodes a homeodomain transcriptional activator that activates transcription in a combinatorial manner (6,5). Pho2p is required to express genes in several different pathways such as purine nucleotide biosynthesis, histidine biosynthesis, and phosphate utilization (7). Genes that are known to be regulated by Pho2p include PHO5, PHO81, HIS4, CYC1, TRP4, HO, ADE1, ADE2, ADE5,7 and ADE8 (4). Although purified Pho2p has been shown in vitro to have low affinity DNA binding activity, in vivo, it activates transcription along with one of at least three distinct partner proteins: the zinc finger protein Swi5p (8), the basic-helix-loop-helix factor Pho4p (9), and Bas1p, a myb-like activator (7). Pho2p and Pho4p cooperatively bind to the promoter site of PHO5 (which encodes for a secreted acid phosphatase) and are required for PHO5 expression when cells are starved of phosphate (10). Pho2p and Swi5p together activate HO, while Pho2p and Bas1p activate genes in the purine and histidine biosynthesis pathways (10). Pho2p is phosphorylated by cdc2/CDC28-type kinase at the 'SPIK' site (amino acids 230-233). This phosphorylation of Pho2p facilitates the interaction between Pho2p and Pho4p which is required for PHO5 expression under low phosphate conditions. Deletion and point mutation analyses have revealed that the homeodomain (amino acids 77-136) is necessary but not sufficient for cooperative DNA binding, and that a large C-terminal region (amino acids 112-404), including the Pho80p homologous region (amino acids 241-258), is required for interaction with its partners Swi5p, Pho4p, and Bas1p (4)."
},{"body" : "Under aerobic conditions, S. cerevisiae are able to utilize glycerol as a sole carbon and energy source. Glycerol degradation, shown here, is a two-step process mediated by the gene products of GUT1 and GUT2. GUT1 encodes a glycerol kinase that converts glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate in the cytosol. The product of this reaction is transported to the mitochondria where it is oxidized to dihydroxyacetone by the membrane protein Gut2p, a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Dihydroxyacetone is then transported back to the cytosol where it enters into either glycolysis or gluconeogenesis.GUT1 gene expression is carbon source regulated; transcription is repressed when cells are grown on fermentable carbon sources such as glucose and induced on non-fermentable carbon sources such as glycerol or ethanol. On non-fermentable carbon sources, GUT1 transcription is upregulated by the transcriptional activators Adr1p, Ino2p, and Ino4p. Conversely, the negative regulator Opi1p facilitates GUT1 repression. Mutations in the human glycerol kinase homolog of Gut1p are linked to the disease hyperglycerolemia. Of the three clinical forms of this disease, infantile, juvenile, and adult, the infantile and juvenile forms are the most severe with symptoms including elevated levels of glycerol, growth retardation, psychomotor retardation, osteoporosis, and adrenal hypoplasia."
},{"body" : "The S. cerevisiae genome contains seven unlinked loci that encode invertase: SUC1, SUC2, SUC3, SUC4, SUC5, SUC7, and SUC8 (5, 6). This enzyme, also known as beta-fructofuranosidase, beta-fructosidase, or sucrase, plays an important role in sugar metabolism. Invertase catalyzes the hydrolysis of both the disaccharide sucrose (producing the monosaccharides fructose and glucose) and the trisaccharide raffinose (producing fructose and melibiose) (7, 8). All invertase genes except SUC2 are located within telomere sequences (9). Although individual strains may carry any number and combination of SUC genes, the reference strain (S288C) encodes only SUC2 (5) and most recent studies on invertase have focused on that gene. SUC2 encodes two different forms of invertase, external and internal. External invertase is a highly-glycosylated homodimer that is excreted into the periplasmic space, where the hydrolysis occurs. Only the monosaccharide products of the reaction, glucose and fructose, are transported into the cell. Internal invertase also forms a homodimer, but is not glycosylated and is localized to the cytoplasm (7, 10). Internal invertase has no known function in sucrose fermentation or any other biological process. The two forms of invertase are translated from two distinct, differentially regulated mRNAs, which differ only in their 5'-ends. The 1.9 kb mRNA encodes the external form and specifies a leader peptide which directs the protein product into the secretory pathway. This signal sequence is missing in the 1.8 kb mRNA encoding the internal invertase (4, 11). Although S288C produces both forms of invertase, for technical reasons, only the longer external form is currently represented in SGD. Internal invertase is synthesized constitutively at low levels, while external invertase is subject to glucose repression (4). Under glucose-repressing conditions, the Mig1p-Cyc8p-Tup1p complex binds directly to the SUC2 promoter, which is packaged into an array of evenly positioned nucleosomes. Several other factors contribute to the repression of SUC2, including Hxk2p (which also binds the SUC2 promoter), Grr1p, Reg1p, Glc7p and Gcr1p. Under inducing conditions, the nucleosomes are remodeled in a SWI/SNF-dependent manner. The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is necessary for both the initiation and the maintenance of SUC2 transcription (12, 13, 14 and references therein). Invertase played a notable role in early research on basic enzyme function. The colloquial name invertase comes from the fact that a solution of sucrose polarizes light in the opposite direction from an equimolar solution of glucose + fructose. This inversion of sugar provided a straightforward functional assay which, along with the easy preparation of a periplasmic protein (15 and references therein), made invertase a popular research subject among early biochemists. Many seminal works defining and describing enzymes, including those of Adrian Brown (16) and Leonor Michaelis and Maude Menton (17), focused on invertase. Invertase also has a role in the food industry where it is used to produce fructose for use in confectionary. Fructose is often preferred over sucrose in candies with soft centers, as it is sweeter and less prone to crystallization (18)."
},{"body" : "GAT1 encodes a transcriptional activator that is involved in the positive regulation of genes subject to nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) (9). Gat1p and Gln3p are both required for activation of NCR-sensitive genes, but the degree to which they influence the expression of a given gene is dependent on the individual gene as well as the nature and quality of the nitrogen source available in the media (10, 1, 3). As determined by sequence homology to Gln3p, Gat1p contains a zinc finger binding domain that binds to the sequence 5-GATAAG-3 in the UASNTR found in the promoters of many genes involved in nitrogen utilization (3, 11). Some of the genes under Gat1p regulation include the general amino acid permease gene GAP1, the glutamine synthetase gene GLN1 (3), and CAR1, ASP3, PUT1, and PUT2, which encode enzymes involved in the degradation of 0006527>arginine<go, asparagine, and proline respectively (12, 13, 10). Both the synthesis and the activity of Gat1p are regulated by the quality of environmental nitrogen. When cells are grown on nitrogen-poor media, GAT1 transcription is upregulated by Gln3p (1). Under nitrogen-rich conditions, downregulation of GAT1 transcription is mediated by the repressor Dal80p (1). Ssy1p, a component of the SPS sensor of extracellular amino acids, is also involved in regulating GAT1 expression (14). When optimal nitrogen sources are available, pre-existing Gat1p is phosphorylated by the TOR kinases Tor1p and Tor2p (15). The phosphorylated form of Gat1p is bound by the regulatory protein Ure2p, which sequesters it in the cytosol, preventing transcription of NCR-sensitive genes (16). In contrast, when nitrogen is limiting, Gat1p is dephosphorylated by the phosphatase Sit4p, subsequently enters the nucleus, and interacts with the transcriptional co-activator Hfi1p to upregulate the expression of NCR-sensitive genes (15, 16, 17). There is also evidence to indicate that activation of Gat1p is dependent on the kinases Arg82p and Kcs1p (18) and antagonized by the transcription factor Gzf3p"
},{"body" : "Hsp40/DnaJ is a family of proteins, established by bacterial DnaJ, that regulates Hsp70 chaperone activity. Hsp40s stimulate the intrinsically weak ATPase activity of Hsp70 proteins and facilitate Hsp70 interaction with polypeptide substrates. Hsp70 family members often have multiple Hsp40 partners, and these specific pairings govern Hsp70 chaperone involvement in particular processes (reviewed in 5, 6, and 7). All Hsp40s contain a highly conserved 75-amino acid J domain, which interacts with the ATPase domain of Hsp70 to stimulate ATP hydrolysis. However, there are also other conserved structural domains, and based on the presence or absence of these regions, the Hsp40 family can be divided into three subtypes: type I, type II and type III (a comprehensive overview of the structural features of the different HSP40 subtypes can be found in 7). Sequence analysis of the S. cerevisiae genome has revealed 22 proteins in the Hsp40/DnaJ family: YDJ1, XDJ1, APJ1, SIS1, DJP1, ZUO1, SWA2, JJJ1, JJJ2, JJJ3, CAJ1, CWC23, MDJ1, MDJ2, PAM18, JAC1, JID1, SCJ1, HLJ1, JEM1, SEC63, and ERJ5 (7). Mdj1p is a type I HSP40 protein that acts as a co-chaperone for Ssc1p in the mitochondrial matrix (reviewed in 7 and 8). Mdj1p is not required for assisting Ssc1p during protein import, but instead participates in folding newly imported and nascent peptides, refolding heat-denatured peptides, and preventing aggregation of unfolded proteins as part of an Ssc1p folding complex (Ssc1p-Mge1p-Mdj1p) (9, 3, 2). Mdj1p is also required for degradation of misfolded proteins, proper mitochondrial DNA inheritance, and maintenance of the activity of mitochondrial DNA polymerase Mip1p (4, 10, 11). Loss of Mdj1p activity results in temperature sensitivity, a respiratory defect, and loss of the mitochondrial genome (1, 10). MDJ1 expression is upregulated upon heat shock via binding of the transcription factor Hsf1p to a non-canonical heat shock element present in the MDJ1 promoter (12). Mdj1p can partially substitute for bacterial DnaJ activity, and homologs from plant (GFA2) and human (DNAJA3) are able to complement an mdj1 null strain (13, 14, 15)."
},{"body" : "IZH1, IZH2, IZH3, and IZH4 encode a family of paralogous membrane proteins thought to affect zinc homeostasis either by altering membrane sterol content or by directly altering cellular zinc levels. The Izh proteins belong to a large and nearly ubiquitous family of proteins found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This family is characterized by the presence of at least seven transmembrane domains and four highly conserved motifs rich in metal-binding amino acids. All of the conserved motifs are predicted to cluster on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. Izh2p is located in the plasma membrane.All four IZH genes exhibit elevated expression in zinc-deficient cells. IZH1 and IZH2 are direct targets of the Zap1p transcription factor that senses zinc deficiency, whereas IZH4 is induced by excess zinc. IZH1 and IZH2 possess putative zinc responsive elementsin their promoter regions, located at -416and -225, respectively. IZH1, IZH2, and IZH4 are also induced by fatty acids via the Oaf1p/Pip2p complex that binds to oleate response elements. Putative OREs are present in the IZH1, IZH2, and IZH4promoters. The induction of IZH1 and IZH2 by Zap1p under zinc deficiency, as well as the specific decrease in Zap1p activity in cells overexpressing Izh proteins, suggests a connection between these genes, sterols, and zinc metabolism.No single IZH gene or combination of genes is essential for viability. Deletion of either IZH1 or IZH2 results in increased sensitivity to elevated zinc, whereas deletion of IZH3 or IZH4 results in reduced sensitivity. The izh2 mutation increases the length of the cell cycle in zinc-treated cells, whereas izh3 mutation decreases the lag phase under the same conditions. Overexpression of any of these four genes results in decreased activity of the Zap1p transcription factor when cells are grown in zinc-limiting medium.Three possible functions have been proposed for the Izh proteins. First, these proteins may function solely in sterol metabolism by influencing the permeability of the plasma membrane and, consequently, the homeostasis of cations such as zinc. It is also possible that the Izh proteins function as transporters for zinc used in a signaling capacity, a possibility that may explain their regulation by Zap1p and their effect on Zap1p activity. A third possibility is that the Izh proteins are involved in a signal transduction cascade that is independent of zinc, and that Zap1p is a downstream target of this pathway."
},{"body" : "Gluconeogenesis is the process whereby glucose is synthesized from non-carbohydrate precursors, which enables yeast cells to grow on non-sugar carbon sources like ethanol, glycerol, or peptone. The reactions of gluconeogenesis, shown here, mediate conversion of pyruvate to glucose, which is the opposite of glycolysis, the formation of pyruvate from glucose. While these two pathways have several reactions in common, they are not the exact reverse of each other. As the glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase (Pfk1p, Pfk2p) and pyruvate kinase (Cdc19p) only function in the forward direction, the gluconeogenesis pathway replaces those steps with the enzymes pyruvate carboxylase (Pyc1p, Pyc2p) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1p)-generating oxaloacetate as an intermediate from pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate-and also the enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fbp1p) (reviewed in 6). Overall, the gluconeogenic reactions convert two molecules of pyruvate to a molecule of glucose, with the expenditure of six high-energy phosphate bonds, four from ATP and two from GTP. Expression of genes encoding several of the gluconeogenic enzymes is subject to glucose repression (7). In addition to regulation of transcription (through catabolite repression), the amount of Fbp1p in the cell is regulated by mRNA and protein degradation when glucose-starved cells are replenished with glucose (8, 9). There appear to be two pathways for degradation of Fbp1p: a proteasomal pathway that acts following short-term glucose starvation and a vacuolar pathway that functions following long-term glucose starvation (3). Transcriptional regulation is effected through consensus sequences in the FBP1 promoter region for the repressor Mig1p, the activating HAP complex, and the derepressing zinc finger protein Cat8p (10, reviewed in 6)."
},{"body" : "MET17 encodes a bifunctional enzyme with O-acetylserine and O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylase activities (4, 5, 6). Met17p functions in cells to catalyze the incorporation of sulfide into O-acetylhomoserine to form homocysteine, which is then used in the biosynthesis of the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine (7). Met17p forms a homotetrameric enzyme of four subunits (8) and binding to pyridoxal phosphate enhances the stability of the protein (9). Transcription of MET17 is mainly regulated by the transcription factors of the sulfur metabolic network; it is positively regulated by Met4p and Cbf1p and negatively regulated by Met31p and Met32p (10, 11, 12, 13). MET17 expression can also be regulated by Gcn4p, Cbf1p, and Sir4p (14, 15, 16, 17). Strains null for met17 require organic sulfur sources for growth and are thus auxotrophs for methionine, cysteine, homocysteine, and AdoMet (7, 1, 18, 19); they are also resistant to methyl mercury and cadmium (19, 20). In the presence of Pb2+, met17 null colonies become darkly pigmented (21). Met17p homologs can be found in numerous organisms including bacteria, archaea, fungi, and plants (22, 23, 24, 25). O-acetylhomoserine sulfhydrylases, bacterial cystathionine gamma-lyases and cystathionine beta-lyases, as well as eukaryotic cystathionine gamma-lyase all share some sequence similarity and are thought to have descended from an ancestral pyridoxal phosphate enzyme (reviewed in 7)."
},{"body" : "CAT8 encodes a zinc-finger cluster protein that mediates derepression of a number of genes during the diauxic shift, which is the transition between fermentative and nonfermentative metabolism (1). Genomic studies have shown that least 30 genes, encoding proteins involved in gluconeogenesis, ethanol utilization, and the glyoxylate cycle, are regulated by Cat8p (5, 11). In addition, Cat8p and the transcription factor Adr1p coregulate a number of genes (11). Under conditions in which glucose is plentiful, expression of CAT8 is repressed by the DNA binding protein Mig1p, which recruits the repressor complex Ssn6p-Tup1p and binds to a site in the CAT8 promoter (1, 12). When availability of glucose decreases, Mig1p is phosphorylated and transported to the cytoplasm, relieving repression of Cat8p and likely recruiting a transcription activator of CAT8 expression as well (13). Cat8p functions to derepress transcription of target genes by binding to the CSRE (carbon source-responsive element) upstream of these genes (12, 14). At least some of the genes activated by Cat8p encode additional transcription factors such as Sip4p, which functions in later steps of the derepression process (14). While glucose regulates transcription of CAT8, it also appears to regulate Cat8p activity; Cat8p is phosphorylated in derepressed cells and addition of glucose triggers dephosphorylation (12)."
},{"body" : "Fet3p and Ftr1p comprise the cell-surface (6, 7, 1) high-affinity iron uptake system (8, 9) which imports iron when it is present in low concentrations. Fet3p is a multicopper ferroxidase (6, 7, 1, 10) that receives iron(II) ions from cell-surface iron reductases such as Fre1p and Fre2p and passes iron(III) ions to the iron permease Ftr1p (9). S. cerevisiae is also capable of acquiring iron via a low-affinity uptake system (Fet4p) or via bacterial siderophores. For proper cell-surface targeting, the Fet3p-Ftr1p complex must be assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (11). Without Fet3p, Ftr1p is retained in the ER (9). Without Ftr1p, Fet3p proceeds as far as the Golgi apparatus, but is misglycosylated and recycled back to the ER (12). Fet3p acquires copper, which is necessary for its oxidase activity (7, 1), from Ccc2p in a post-Golgi compartment (7, 13, 14, 15). Copper acquisition requires genes involved in vacuolar assembly (15) (including TFP1 (16) and VPS41 (14)) and the presence of chloride as an allosteric effector, not as a counter-charge (17). The Fet3p ferroxidase site is also capable of oxidizing copper(I) (4, 18) and is inhibited by azide (10). Holo-Fet3p contains four copper(I) ions (10). Transcription of FET3 and FTR1 is inhibited by high iron and induced under conditions of low iron (7, 1, 19, 20) or low oxygen (20, 21, 22). FET3 and FTR1 are induced by Aft1p (9, 13, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27) and Aft2p (27), which are inhibited by a signal from mitochondrial iron-sulfur clusters, not cytosolic iron (28, 29). In mutants lacking the yeast frataxin homolog Yfh1p, iron accumulates in the mitochondria and FET3 and FTR1 are induced 10- to 50-fold (30). Independent of iron levels, FET3 and FTR1 are induced under glucose depletion by Aft1p (31); Snf4p and Snf1p are required. Copper also induces transcription of FET3 and FTR1 via Aft1p (26), and FET3 is induced by chloroquine (32). Exposure to high iron initiates the degradation of the Fet3p-Ftr1p complex. In high iron, Ftr1p becomes hyperubiquitinated, and the complex is targeted to the vacuole via endocytosis. Degradation requires iron to be transported through Ftr1p; the presence of iron in the cytosol is not sufficient (33). fet3 mutants exhibit several phenotypes which can be suppressed by growing the cells in high iron. Among them are: deficient growth in low iron (1), on ethanol (indicating a defect in respiration) (7), on galactose/raffinose (34), at alkaline pH (35), or at pH7 in minimal media (16). fet3 mutants are sensitive to copper (4, 36, 37) and other transition metals (37); the cell compensates for deletion of FET3 by increasing expression of FET4, which imports other transition metals promiscuously (37). Fet3p is homologous to two human proteins. Ceruloplasmin (CP) (OMIM) is a soluble protein highly expressed in liver and found in serum; deficiency of CP causes a pleiotropic condition called aceruloplasminemia (OMIM). Hephaestin (OMIM) is an X-linked gene found primarily at the tips of intestinal villi. Human hephaestin complements deletion of FET3 (38), as does C. albicans FET3 (39). A truncated, soluble form of Fet3p is blue in color (5) and complements deletion of ceruloplasmin in mice (40). Coordinate expression in S. cerevisiae of both fio1+ and fip1+ from S. pombe, the homologs of FET3 and FTR1, respectively, complements deletion of FET3, indicating that fio1+ is a functional homolog of Fet3p but is incapable of interacting with Ftr1p (19)."
},{"body" : "Transcriptional regulation is an important mechanism for controlling carbon metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Snf1p kinase complex, which phosphorylates serine and threonine residues, is essential for regulating the transcriptional changes associated with glucose derepression through its activation of the transcriptional activators Cat8p and Sip4p, and its deactivation of the transcriptional repressor Mig1p. The complex has also been shown to be involved in multiple processes, including phosphorylation of histone H3; direct regulation of RNA polymerase II holoenzyme; regulation of translation, glycogen biosynthesis, and lipid biosynthesis; and regulation of general stress responses, response to salt stress and response to heat stress. The active Snf1p kinase complex is a heterotrimeric complex composed of Snf1p, the catalyticsubunit; Snf4p, a regulatorysubunit; and one of three possible beta subunitswhich appear to tether Snf1p and Snf4p together and also may determine substrate specificity of the Snf1p kinase complex.The Snf1p kinase complex belongs to a highly conserved family of serine/threonine protein kinases, and homologs to each of the subunitshave been found in all eukaryotes, including plants and mammals.Snf4p appears to activate Snf1p by inhibiting the autoinhibitory interaction of the C-terminusof Snf1p with the catalytic N-terminus of Snf1p, but Snf4p does not influence the phosphorylation state of Snf1p. Snf4p is associated with Snf1p in cells grown in both high and low levels of glucose. SNF4 is not regulated by glucose repression, but binding of Snf4p to Elc1p inhibits the degradation of Snf4p.snf4 null mutants are viable, but are unable to grow on maltose or on non-fermentable carbon sources. As compared to wild type, snf4 null mutants display increased temperature sensitivity, an extended generational life span, a shortened G1 phase and longer S and G2 phases, and decreased production of Cdc28p during growth in glucose-limited cultures, and they also lack peroxisomes.Snf4p has similarity to human PRKAG2, mutations in which are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Snf4p also contains a region with homology to the known mammalian Elongin C binding proteins, and this region is necessary for the interaction between Snf4p and Elc1p. The growth defects of snf4 null mutants are complemented by Arabidopsis thaliana SNF4 and Candida albicans SNF4."

In a process critical for accurate translation of the genetic code, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetasesattach amino acids specifically to cognate tRNAs, thereby \"charging\" the tRNAs. The catalysis is accomplished via a two-step mechanism. First, the synthetase activates the amino acid in an ATP-dependent reaction, producing aminoacyl-adenylate and releasing inorganic pyrophosphate. Second, the enzyme binds the correct tRNA and transfers the activated amino acid to either the 2' or 3' terminal hydroxyl group of the tRNA, forming the aminoacyl-tRNA and AMP.Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases possess precise substrate specificity and, despite their similarity in function, vary in size, primary sequence and subunit composition. Individual members of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family can be categorized in one of two classes, depending on amino acid specificity. Class I enzymestypically contain two highly conserved sequence motifs, are monomeric or dimeric, and aminoacylate at the 2' terminal hydroxyl of the appropriate tRNA. Class II enzymestypically contain three highly conserved sequence motifs, are dimeric or tetrameric, and aminoacylate at the 3' terminal hydroxyl of the appropriate tRNA."
},{"body" : "Pig2p is a putative type-1 protein phosphatasetargeting subunit that tethers the Glc7p type-1 protein phosphatase to the Gsy2p glycogen synthase. Pig2p binds Gsy2p in two-hybrid analyses, and displays 30% similarity to Gip2p, another putative regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase Glc7p.  One traditional analysis has shown that a pig2 null mutant in the EG328-1A strain background accumulates normal levels of glycogen. However, in a large-scale study using a homozygous diploid deletion series in the BY4743 strain background, a pig2 null mutant accumulates less glycogen than wild type. glc7-109 mutants display increased levels of glycogen, and this hyperglycogen phenotype is partially retained in pig1 gac1 gip2 triple null glc7-109 mutants, indicating that Pig2p may be a redundant targeting subunit capable of targeting Glc7p-109 to Gsy2p.  Gac1p, Pig1p, Pig2p and Gip2p are the only four yeast proteins that share a conserved segment of 25 residues, designated the GVNK motif, which is also found in mammalian type-1 protein phosphatase targeting subunits. Pig2p also possesses two short regions of similarity to the Rhizopus glucoamylase precursor AMYG, and to various mammalian glycogen-associated regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase 1, including rabbit RG RAB and human PPP1R3, mutations in which are associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."
},{"body" : "The widespread biological phenomenon of multidrug resistanceposes serious challenges for the treatment of human cancers, and also of bacterial and fungal infections. MDR is typically associated with transport systems that catalyze the efflux of various compounds out of the cell. Among the most important MDR transporters are those belonging to the major facilitator superfamily. MFS-MDR transporters are found in Eucarya, Bacteria, and Archaea, and have been classified into two families based on the number of predicted transmembrane spans: The Drug:H+ Antiporter-1Family, TC 2.A.1.2, and the Drug:H+ Antiporter-2Family, TC 2.A.1.3.  In S. cerevisiae, the DHA1 family comprises 12 genes involved in various biological processes: AQR1, QDR1, QDR2, QDR3, FLR1, DTR1, TPO1, TPO2, TPO3, TPO4, HOL1, and YHK8. Aqr1p, Qdr1-3p, and Flr1p are plasma membrane proteins that serve as multidrug transporters. Aqr1p has also been implicated in the excretion of excess amino acids, and Qdr2p in the import of potassium ions. Dtr1p, a putative dityrosine transporter, resides in the prospore membrane and functions in spore wall synthesis. Tpo1-4p are membrane proteins involved in the export of polyamines, including spermine, spermidine, and putrescine. Hol1p participates in cation and alcohol transport, and Yhk8p is a putative drug transporter requiring further experimental characterization.  The 12 DHA1 family genes of S. cerevisiae are similar to several ion and amine transporters in human, including SLC22A5, SLC22A11, SLC22A13, SLC22A14, and SLC22A3, which function primarily in the elimination of drugs and other xenobiotics from various tissues. Mutations in the human genes have been implicated in Crohn's disease, hypoglycemia, and various myopathies."
},{"body" : "BAS1 encodes a transcription factor involved in the expression of genes encoding enzymes acting in the histidine, purine, and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways. A genome-wide survey of genes regulated by Bas1p was performed by Denis et al.. Bas1p acts in conjunction with Grf10pin a TATA-independent fashion. Bas1p has been shown to bind to a site containing a TGACTC hexanucleotide found in the ADE2 and ADE5,7 promoters. This motif is required for the regulation of ADE2 expression by Bas1p/Bas2p. A model for the action of Bas1p and Bas2p is that formation of a complex between the two proteins unmasks an activator function in Bas1p. Moreover, in adenine-replete cells, there may be a negative regulator that inhibits formation of this complex. However, there is evidence that there may be other partners that can bind Bas1p. The N-terminal region of Bas1p is similar to those of proteins in the myb proto-oncogene family."
},{"body" : "ADR1 encodes a transcriptional activator involved in the expression of genes that are regulated by glucose repression. Adr1p was first identified as a transcription factor mediating expression of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene ADH2, but it is now known to also activate genes involved glucose fermentation, glycerol metabolism, fatty acid utilization, and peroxisome biogenesis. Adr1p binds as a monomer to two half-sitesof the palindromic UAS1 element in the promoters of these genes. Overexpression or deletion of ADR1 strongly deregulates the glucose response of Adr1p target genes.The Adr1p DNA binding domainconsists of two Cys2His2 zinc fingers and an N-terminal proximal accessory region, which provides additional DNA contacts required for high-affinity binding. Adr1p also contains four transcriptional activation domainsthat are functionally redundant and interact with transcription factors such as Sua7p, TFIID, Ada2p, and Gcn5p.Chromatin modification is required for and affected by Adr1p binding; loss of histone deacetylase activity allows Adr1p to bind promoters under repressing conditions, and Adr1p has been shown to mediate nucleosome repositioning in the ADH2 promoter. The protein kinase Snf1p positively regulates Adr1p binding in the absence of glucose while the type 1 protein phosphatasecomplex Glc7p/Reg1p inhibits the ability of Adr1p to bind DNA in the presence of glucose. The PP1 complex also affects ADR1 transcription levels and Adr1p activity through post-translational modification. Direct phosphorylation by protein kinases, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase, influences Adr1p expression and function as well."
},{"body" : "The paralogous genes HYP2 and ANB1 encode the translation elongation factor eIF-5A. The two gene products are 90% identical to each other. Because Hyp2p is expressed under normal, aerobic growth conditions while Anb1p is expressed only under anaerobic conditions, most functional studies have focused on Hyp2p. However, since the two proteins are functionally interchangeable in vivo, results obtained with Hyp2p are likely to be directly applicable to Anb1p.eIF-5A was long considered to be a translation initiation factor based on in vitro assays of certain aspects of translation; however, since some in vitro assays did not suggest a role in initiation, and since depletion of eIF-5A does not severely affect overall translation, its role was unclear. Since then, detailed studies of hyp2 conditional mutant phenotypes have revealed translational defects and alterations in polysome profiles characteristic of elongation factor mutations, as well as decreased accumulation of P-bodies, which is known to occur in elongation mutants. HYP2 also displays synthetic genetic interactions with translation elongation factor mutants, and physical interaction with elongation factor eEF2. Furthermore, Hyp2p stimulates both translation elongation and termination in vitro. Thus, multiple lines of evidence are consistent with a primary role for eIF-5A in promoting translation elongation.eIF-5A is highly conserved across all species. The human ortholog EIF5Acomplements the inviability of the yeast hyp2 anb1 double null mutant. Both Hyp2p and Anb1p undergo the conversion of a single lysine residue to hypusine-lysine), which is essential for function. The modification is conserved among eIF-5A orthologs in eukaryotes and Archaea, and eIF-5A orthologs are the only known hypusinated proteins. eIF-5A orthologs in Eubacterial species, such as elongation factor P, are not hypusinated. Hypusination of Hyp2p is essential for two kinds of protein-protein interactions in which it participates: homodimer formation; and binding to intact 80S ribosomes, with a preference for actively translating ribosomes. Both Hyp2p and Anb1p are also phosphorylated on a serine residue, but this modification has no obvious effects on function.The hyp2 null mutant in strain W303 is inviable under standardconditions although growth is observed under anaerobic conditions due to ANB1 expression; conversely, the anb1 null mutant fails to grow under anaerobic conditions but has no apparent phenotype under aerobic conditions. The hyp2 null mutant is slow-growing, rather than inviable, under standard conditions in a different strain background. The hyp2 anb1 double null mutant is inviable under all conditions.Transcription of ANB1 is tightly regulated by the presence of oxygen, and ANB1 has been studied extensively as an example of an anaerobically expressed gene. Anb1p is undetectable under aerobic conditions, and its mRNA is 200-fold more abundant in the absence of oxygen than in its presence. Transcriptional repression of ANB1 under aerobic conditions is mediated by the transcription factors Rox1p and Mot3p, which cooperate to recruit the Cyc8p-Tup1p general co-repressor complex to the ANB1 promoter."

Reduction- or loss-of-function mutations in ADE13 relieve the transcriptional repression of the ADE genes by adenine, suggesting that AMP plays a role in mediating adenine repression. Only the most severe ade13 mutations also cause adenine auxotrophy, indicating that low levels of Ade13p activity are sufficient for growth in the absence of adenine.Ade13p is a widely conserved protein, and orthologs have been described in bacteria, chicken, and humans. Mutations in the human gene ADSL cause adenylosuccinase deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive disease that causes severe mental retardation, and in some cases convulsions, autism, and growth retardation."
},{"body" : "Transcriptional regulation is an important mechanism for controlling carbon metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Snf1p kinase complex, which phosphorylates serine and threonine residues, is essential for regulating the transcriptional changes associated with glucose derepression through its activation of the transcriptional activators Cat8p and Sip4p, and its deactivation of the transcriptional repressor Mig1p. The complex has also been shown to be involved in multiple processes, including phosphorylation of histone H3; direct regulation of RNA polymerase II holoenzyme; regulation of translation, glycogen biosynthesis, and lipid biosynthesis; and regulation of general stress responses, response to salt stress and response to heat stress. The active Snf1p kinase complex is a heterotrimeric complex composed of Snf1p, the catalyticsubunit; Snf4p, a regulatorysubunit; and one of three possible beta subunitswhich appear to tether Snf1p and Snf4p together and also may determine substrate specificity of the Snf1p kinase complex.The Snf1p kinase complex belongs to a highly conserved family of serine/threonine protein kinases, and homologs to each of the subunitshave been found in all eukaryotes, including plants and mammals.Snf4p appears to activate Snf1p by inhibiting the autoinhibitory interaction of the C-terminusof Snf1p with the catalytic N-terminus of Snf1p, but Snf4p does not influence the phosphorylation state of Snf1p. Snf4p is associated with Snf1p in cells grown in both high and low levels of glucose. SNF4 is not regulated by glucose repression, but binding of Snf4p to Elc1p inhibits the degradation of Snf4p.snf4 null mutants are viable, but are unable to grow on maltose or on non-fermentable carbon sources. As compared to wild type, snf4 null mutants display increased temperature sensitivity, an extended generational life span, a shortened G1 phase and longer S and G2 phases, and decreased production of Cdc28p during growth in glucose-limited cultures, and they also lack peroxisomes.Snf4p has similarity to human PRKAG2, mutations in which are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Snf4p also contains a region with homology to the known mammalian Elongin C binding proteins, and this region is necessary for the interaction between Snf4p and Elc1p. The growth defects of snf4 null mutants are complemented by Arabidopsis thaliana SNF4 and Candida albicans SNF4."

When U5 associates with the U4/U6 complex to form the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex, Aar2p is released from the U5 snRNP. The role of Aar2p in mRNA splicing appears to be that of a recycling factor required to regenerate the form of the U5 snRNP that can associate with the U4/U6 snRNP complex to regenerate the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP .

Aar2p was originally characterized as a factor specifically required for the splicing of MATa1 pre-mRNA, but not for splicing of ACT1 pre-mRNA . The apparent specificity of the aar2 mutant defect in MATa1 pre-mRNA splicing seems to be due to a recycling defect  exacerbated by the presence of two introns within the same gene, a rare occurrance in S. cerevisiae.

Abf1p binding to these sites directly mediates a number of different chromatin-related events such as DNA replication, gene silencing, chromatin remodeling, nucleotide excision repair, and gene activation and repression. The genes that Abf1p transcriptionally regulates are involved in a diverse range of cellular processes including carbon source regulation, nitrogen utilization, sporulation, meiosis, and ribosomal function.The structure of Abf1p is similar to that of many other site-specific transcription factors. It has a bipartite N-terminal DNA-binding domainand a C-terminal activation domain, with both domains being essential for cell viability. Within the activation domain are two regions named CS1and CS2that are responsible for mediating nuclear localization and chromatin remodeling, respectively.Abf1p levels are abundant in the cell and Abf1p binding sites in the genome are occupied in vivo under all conditions studied thus far. Nevertheless, it has been shown that Abf1p is able to repress its own transcription via binding at a consensus site in the ABF1 promoter. The binding activity of Abf1p is stimulated by Cdc6p, a protein involved in DNA replication. Abf1p activity also appears to depend on its phosphorylation state. Abf1p can be phosphorylated at multiple sites, partially through the action of serine/threonine kinase, and the extent of Abf1p phosphorylation depends on growth conditions and carbon source. Changes in Abf1p phosphorylation have been shown to correlate with regulation of expression of the Abf1p target gene COX6, linking Abf1p phosphorylation with carbon-source control of COX6. Dephosphorylation requires the presence of functional Cyc8p. Nuclear import of Abf1p is dependent on the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor Srm1p, but Abf1p is also found to bind to the importin protein Pse1p, suggesting that import may be mediated by more than one pathway.

Actin is an ATP-binding protein that exists both in monomericand filamentousforms. Actin filaments are assembled by the reversible polymerization of monomers and have an intrinsic polarity; the fast-growing end is called the barbed end and the slow-growing end is called the pointed end. Yeast cells contain three types of filamentous actin structures:  actin cables, an actin-myosin  contractile ring, and  actin cortical patches, all of which undergo extensive reorganization throughout the cell cycle. Actin patches appear by fluorescence microscopy as cortical puncta, and are highly motile structures comprised of actin filaments that undergo rapid turnover. Actin patch assembly depends upon the actin-nucleating Arp2/3 complex. Actin patches are implicated in maintaining  cell polarity, cell wall integrity, and endocytotic internalization. Actin cables are aligned with the mother-bud axis and are composed of bundles of actin filaments. Actin cables serve as tracks for polarized  secretion, organelle and mRNA transport, and mitotic  spindle alignment. The assembly of actin cables is dependent on the functionally redundant formins, Bni1p and Bnr1p.

These complexes function in positive and negative transcriptional regulation of numerous RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes; in addition, SLIK plays a role in the retrograde response. The three complexes each contain the histone acetyltransferase catalytic subunit Gcn5p, which interacts directly with Ada2p and preferentially modifies histones H3 and H2B. In vitro, Gcn5p acetylates N-terminal lysines on free histones, but acetylation of nucleosomal histone substrates also requires Ada2p and Ngg1p, which are found in a complex with Gcn5p. Ada2p has been shown to increase the HAT activity of Gcn5p, while Ngg1p plays a role in expanding the range of lysines that undergo acetylation.Independently of its interaction with Gcn5p, Ada2p has also been shown to function in transcriptional silencing at telomeres and ribosomal DNA. Ada2p binds telomeric chromatin and Sir2p to prevent the spread of silencing proteins Sir2p and Sir3p into subtelomeric regions.Null mutations in ADA2 confer slow growth in minimal glucose media, resistance to the toxic effect of the chimeric transcriptional activator GAL4-VP16, and silencing defects. The null mutant also grows poorly on low phosphate medium, and exhibits increased sensitivity to ethanol or caffeine. Microarray analysis indicates that 2.5% of S. cerevisiae open reading frames show a twofold or greater change in expression in the null mutant. The amino terminal region of Ada2p contains a ZZ-type zinc finger and a SANT domain, which is found in other proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, such as Swi3pand Rsc8p.

Mutations in the Ada2p SANT domain confer growth and histone acetylation defects, indicating that this region is essential for the function of the HAT complexes. The amino terminal region of Ada2p is required for interaction with Gcn5p, whereas interaction with Ngg1p is mediated by the central region. Mutant analysis indicates that the central region is also required for full Gcn5p acetyltransferase activity and substrate specificity; in addition, it has been shown to bind phosphatidylserine.

Maximal ADE2 expression is dependent on the transcriptional activators Gcn4p, Bas1p, and Pho2p, which bind to 5-TGACTC-3 sites in the ADE2 promoter. Gcn4p upregulates ADE2 expression during amino acid starvation, a condition which inhibits Gcn4p degradation. Bas1p binds the ADE2 promoter in both repressing and derepressing growth conditions, but binding increases slightly when adenine is limiting. Under derepressing conditions, Pho2p also binds the ADE2 promoter in a Bas1p-dependent manner, and transcription is induced. Derepression by Bas1p and Pho2p also requires the purine biosynthesis pathway intermediates 5-phosphoribosyl-4-succinocarboxamide-5-aminoimidazole and 5-phosphoribosyl-4-carboxamide- 5-aminoimidazole, which are thought to promote interaction between these two activators.Mutations in ADE2 lead to the accumulation of purine precursors in the vacuole, which causes the colony to be red in color. This pigmentation phenotype is widely utilized as a marker for genetic selection and screening."},{"body" : "ADE4 encodes 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase, also known as amidophosphoribosyltransferase or PRPPAT, which catalyzes the first step of the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway. Expression of ADE4, and of other genes in the yeast ADE regulon, is repressed by the presence of purine bases and derepressed in the absence of purines through the action of transcription factors such as Bas1p, Pho2p, and Gcn4p. Bas1p binds several ADE promotersand DNA-bound Bas1p recruits Pho2p to activate ADE genes in S. cerevisiae. Gcn4p also regulates the expression of these genes. There are three Gcn4p responsive elementsin the 5-flanking region of ADE4. Two GCREs are essential to synergistically activate ADE4 transcription by binding Gcn4p. The distal GCRE1 is also required for basal transcription of ADE4. Ade4p forms cytoplasmic foci in the absence of adenine, and cycling between punctate and diffuse cellular distribution can be controlled by adenine subtraction and addition.  ade4 null mutants exhibit adenine auxotrophy, decreased resistance to ethanol, and slow growth. Cisplatin resistance is conferred either by an ADE4 activation mutation, which causes constitutive AMP synthesis and hypoxanthine excretion, or by overexpression of ADE4, which increases de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides. Mutations in ADE4 are epistatic with mutations in ADE2, which encodes encodes aminoimidazole ribonucleotide-carboxylase, an enzyme catalyzing the sixth step of purine nucleotide biosynthesis, and with mutations in ADE13, which encodes adenylosuccinate lyase, an enzyme catalyzing steps 8 and 12 of the de novo purine pathway.  Orthologs of Ade4p have been identified in Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Ashbya gossypii, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Gallus gallus, Rattus rattus, and Homo sapiens. The human PRPPAT cDNA complements the S. cerevisiae ade4 null mutant."},{"body" : "In S. cerevisiae, there are five genes that encode alcohol dehydrogenases involved in ethanol metabolism, ADH1 to ADH5. Four of these enzymes, Adh1p, Adh3p, Adh4p, and Adh5p, reduce acetaldehyde to ethanol during glucose fermentation, while Adh2p catalyzes the reverse reaction of oxidizing ethanol to acetaldehyde.The five ethanol dehydrogenasesas well as the bifunctional enzyme Sfa1p are also involved in the production of fusel alcohols during fermentation. Fusel alcohols are end products of amino acid catabolismvia the Ehrlich pathway and contribute to the flavor and aroma of yeast-fermented foods and beverages. They may also have physiological roles. For example, exposing cells to isoamyl alcohol, derived from catabolism of leucine, stimulates filamentous growth. Similarly, other fusel alcohols also stimulate filamentous growth in S. cerevisiae and biofilm formation in the pathogens Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis.The cytosolic ADH1 gene product is the major enzyme responsible for converting acetaldehyde to ethanol. Adh1p functions as a tetramer of four identical subunits with each subunit containing two zinc ions; one zinc atom is essential for catalysis and the other is important for the structure of the protein. Although originally thought to be expressed constitutively, ADH1 transcription is repressed when cells are grown on a non-fermentable carbon source such as ethanol or glycerol. S. cerevisiae cells lacking Adh1p activity grow poorly on glucose under anaerobic conditions and treatment of these cells with a respiratory inhibitor blocks growth completely. Overexpression of ADH1 is able to enhance the formaldehyde resistance of yeast cells.About the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductasefamily Medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, sometimes referred to as long-chain dehydrogenases, constitute an ancient and widespread enzyme superfamily with members found in Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota. Many MDR members are basic metabolic enzymes acting on alcohols or aldehydes, and thus these enzymes may have roles in detoxifying alcohols and related compounds, protecting against environmental stresses such as osmotic shock, reduced or elevated temperatures, or oxidative stress. The family also includes the mammalian zeta-crystallin lens protein, which may protect the lens against oxidative damage and enzymes which produce lignocellulose in plants. MDR enzymes typically have subunits of about 350 aa residues and are two-domain proteins, with a catalytic domain and a second domain for binding to the nicotinamide cofactor, either NADor NADP. They contain 0, 1, or 2 zinc atoms. When zinc is present, it is involved in catalysis at the active site. Based on phylogenetic and sequence analysis, the members of the MDR superfamily can be further divided into more closely related subgroups. In families which are widespread from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, some members appear conserved across all species, while others appear to be due to lineage specific duplications. Some subgroups are only found in certain taxa. S. cerevisiae contains fifteenor twenty-onemembers of the MDR superfamily, listed below.

S. cerevisiae cells lacking alcohol dehydrogenase activity are unable to grow when ethanol is the sole carbon source and these cells also accumulate high levels of glycerol. Although ADH1 and ADH2 share 89% sequence similarity, their gene products differ in metabolic directionality due to their differences in substrate affinity; Adh2p has a ten-fold lower Km for ethanol than all the other alcohol dehydrogenases.Two cis-acting elements in the ADH2 promoter, UAS1and UAS2/CSRE, are both necessary for maximal ADH2 expression. In the absence of a fermentable carbon source, these sites are bound cooperatively by the transcriptional activators Adr1p and Cat8p; Adr1p binds to the UAS1 site while Cat8p binds to the UAS2/CSRE site. The presence of glucose downregulates the levels of these transcription factors which in turn results in ADH2 expression being repressed by several hundred-fold.About the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductasefamily Medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, sometimes referred to as long-chain dehydrogenases, constitute an ancient and widespread enzyme superfamily with members found in Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota.

Adh3p shares roughly 80% amino acid identity with Adh1p and Adh2p. The presence of glucose in the media represses ADH3 expression, although ADH3 glucose-repression is not as severe as that of ADH2. Null mutations in ADH3 do not confer a phenotype under aerobic conditions, but under anaerobic conditions mutant cells grow noticeably slower than wild type cells. This may be due to the suggested involvement of Adh3p in an ethanol-acetaldehyde redox shuttle that is involved in maintaining the mitochondrial redox balance during anaerobic growth.About the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductasefamily Medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, sometimes referred to as long-chain dehydrogenases, constitute an ancient and widespread enzyme superfamily with members found in Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota.

However, unlike Adh1p, Adh2p, and Adh3p, which are thought to function as a tetramers, Adh4p is a dimeric protein. Adh4p requires zinc to function but depleting zinc from the media has been shown to induce ADH4 transcription. ADH4 expression is also upregulated by lithium, a compound that is toxic to yeast cells grown in galactose, and downregulated by DMSO.

In a process critical for accurate translation of the genetic code, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetasesattach amino acids specifically to cognate tRNAs, thereby charging the tRNAs. The catalysis is accomplished via a two-step mechanism. First, the synthetase activates the amino acid in an ATP-dependent reaction, producing aminoacyl-adenylate and releasing inorganic pyrophosphate. Second, the enzyme binds the correct tRNA and transfers the activated amino acid to either the 2 or 3 terminal hydroxyl group of the tRNA, forming the aminoacyl-tRNA and AMP.Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases possess precise substrate specificity and, despite their similarity in function, vary in size, primary sequence and subunit composition. Individual members of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family can be categorized in one of two classes, depending on amino acid specificity. Class I enzymestypically contain two highly conserved sequence motifs, are monomeric or dimeric, and aminoacylate at the 2 terminal hydroxyl of the appropriate tRNA.

Both Hyp2p and Anb1p are also phosphorylated on a serine residue, but this modification has no obvious effects on function.The hyp2 null mutant in strain W303 is inviable under standardconditions although growth is observed under anaerobic conditions due to ANB1 expression; conversely, the anb1 null mutant fails to grow under anaerobic conditions but has no apparent phenotype under aerobic conditions. The hyp2 null mutant is slow-growing, rather than inviable, under standard conditions in a different strain background. The hyp2 anb1 double null mutant is inviable under all conditions.Transcription of ANB1 is tightly regulated by the presence of oxygen, and ANB1 has been studied extensively as an example of an anaerobically expressed gene. Anb1p is undetectable under aerobic conditions, and its mRNA is 200-fold more abundant in the absence of oxygen than in its presence. Transcriptional repression of ANB1 under aerobic conditions is mediated by the transcription factors Rox1p and Mot3p, which cooperate to recruit the Cyc8p-Tup1p general co-repressor complex to the ANB1 promoter."},{"body" : "APA1 and APA2 encode diadenosine 5,5-P1,P4-tetraphosphatephosphorylases, which catabolize bistetraphosphates.

Aqr1p, Qdr1-3p, and Flr1p are plasma membrane proteins that serve as multidrug transporters. Aqr1p has also been implicated in the excretion of excess amino acids, and Qdr2p in the import of potassium ions.

Nat1p/Ard1p transfers an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the alpha-amino group of Ser, Ala, Gly, or Thr N-terminal residues.

The 60S subunit contains 46 proteins and three RNA molecules: 25S RNA of 3392 nt, hydrogen bonded to the 5.8S RNA of 158 nt and associated with the 5S RNA of 121 nt. The 40S subunit has a single 18S RNA of 1798 nt and 33 proteins. All yeast ribosomal proteins have a mammalian homolog.  In a rapidly growing yeast cell, 60% of total transcription is devoted to ribosomal RNA, and 50% of RNA polymerase II transcription and 90% of mRNA splicing are devoted to the production of mRNAs for r-proteins. Coordinate regulation of the rRNA genes and 137 r-protein genes is affected by nutritional cues and a number of signal transduction pathways that can abruptly induce or silence the ribosomal genes, whose transcripts have naturally short lifetimes, leading to major implications for the expression of other genes as well. The expression of some r-protein genes is influenced by Abf1p, and most are directly induced by binding of Rap1p to their promoters, which excludes nucleosomes and recruits Fhl1p and Ifh1p to drive transcription.  Ribosome assembly is a complex process, with different steps occurring in different parts of the cell. Ribosomal protein genes are transcribed in the nucleus, and the mRNA is transported to the cytoplasm for translation. The newly synthesized r-proteins then enter the nucleus and associate in the nucleolus with the two rRNA transcripts, one of which is methylated and pseudouridylated, and then cleaved into three individual rRNAsas part of the assembly process. Separate ribosomal subunits are then transported from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm where they assemble into mature ribosomes before functioning in translation.

ASF1 expression appears to be downregulated in conditions of oxygen deprivationAsf1p is highly conserved in flies and humans but the functions of S. cerevisiae Asf1p appear to be split between two human genes."},{"body" : "ASH1 encodes a GATA-like transcription factor that acts to specify daughter-cell fate in mating-type switching in haploid cells and in pseudohyphal growth in diploid cells deprived of nitrogen. In the context of mating-type switching, Ash1p acts to repress the transcription of HO, which encodes an endonuclease that initiates mating-type switching. Ash1p is required during pseudohyphal growth to activate the transcription of MUC1/FLO11, which encodes a flocculin that helps cells stick together as they grow into the substratum.Mating-type switching occurs only in mother cells because Ash1p prevents HO transcription in daughter cells. Ash1 protein is specifically localized to daughter nuclei late in the cell cycle, where it is poised to inhibit HO transcription in the following G1. This asymmetric localization is achieved by the delivery of ASH1 mRNA to daughter cells by the products of the SHE genes. She2p and Loc1p bind to ASH1 mRNA in mother and daughter nuclei and mediate export to the cytoplasm. She3p then associates with the ribonucleoprotein particleand acts as an adapter for association with the type V myosin Myo4p. Myo4p transports the mRNP complex along actin cables to the bud tip. During telophase, ASH1 mRNA is anchored to the bud tip by Bni1pand/or Hek2p and/or Bud6p. Translation of ASH1 mRNA is coordinated with its transport to the bud tip such that while ASH1 is in transit, translation is delayed.Once in the daughter nucleus, Ash1p binds to its recognition sequencesin the Upstream Repression Sequence 1of the HO promoter. The carboxy-terminus of Ash1p contains the DNA-binding domain and the amino-terminus mediates repression of HO transcription. The Rpd3p histone deacetylase complexhas been shown to contain Ash1p and bind to the HO promoter. Mutants of Rpd3p HDAC components disrupt HO repression, suggesting that chromatin architecture plays a role in regulating HO expression. Because Ash1p can function as part of an HDAC, it is likely to regulate many more genes in the genome.Genes similar to ASH1 are found in ascomycetes and the Candida albicans homolog can substitute for S. cerevisiae ASH1."},{"body" : "Asm4p is a nuclear pore protein that forms a complex with two other nucleoporins, Nup53p and Nup170p. Transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells occurs through the nuclear pore complex, a large macromolecular complex that spans the nuclear envelope. The structure of the vertebrate NPC has been studied extensively; recent reviews include 13, 14, 15, and 16. The yeast NPC shares several features with the vertebrate NPC, despite being smaller and less elaborate. Many yeast nuclear pore proteins, or nucleoporins, have been identified by a variety of genetic approaches. The Asm4p-containing complex also interacts with the karyopherin Pse1p. Lopez et al.report that ASM4 is essential for vegetative growth in some strain backgrounds tested.

Autophagy is a highly conserved eukaryotic pathway for sequestering and transporting bulk cytoplasm, including proteins and organelle material, to the lysosome for degradation. Upon starvation for nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and various amino acids, or upon endoplasmic reticulum stress, cells initiate formation of a double-membrane vesicle, termed an autophagosome, that mediates this process. Approximately 30 autophagy-relatedproteins have been identified in S. cerevisiae, 17 of which are essential for formation of the autophagosome. Null mutations in most of these genes prevent induction of autophagy, and cells do not survive nutrient starvation; however, these mutants are viable in rich medium. Some of the Atg proteins are also involved in a constitutive biosynthetic process termed the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingpathway, which uses autophagosomal-like vesicles for selective transport of hydrolases aminopeptidase Iand alpha-mannosidaseto the vacuole.

The PAS structure generates an isolation membrane, which expands and eventually fuses along the edges to complete vesicle formation. At the vacuole, the outer membrane of the Cvt vesicle fuses with the vacuolar membrane, the vesicle is degraded, and the cargos are released and processed into their mature forms by vacuolar peptidases. The Cvt pathway has not been observed outside of yeast, and enzymes specifically involved in this pathway are not well conserved in other organisms.about ATG1 ATG1 encodes a cytosolic protein kinase required for vesicle formation during autophagy and the Cvt pathway. Atg1p kinase activity is required for initiation of the Cvt pathway as well as for proper localization and cycling of autophagy proteins such as Atg23p. Atg1p also has a role in autophagy unrelated to its kinase activity; it is thought that Atg1p is a structural protein required for efficient PAS organization and assembly. Atg1p kinase activity is stimulated by interaction with Atg13p and Atg17p, and formation of this complex is specific for the role of Atg1p in autophagy initiation. Atg1p also interacts with the Cvt pathway-specific protein Atg11p. Complementation experiments and the presence of PKA phosphorylation sites on Atg1p suggest that regulation of autophagy by the kinases Snf1p, Pho85p, and PKA may occur via regulation of Atg1p. atg1 mutants are defective in autophagy, Cvt transport, sporulation, and survival under starvation conditions.

The final product of these two systems is a lipidated form of Atg8p that appears to be required for membrane tethering and hemifusion, which are essential for autophagosome formation. In the Atg12 system, the ubiquitin-like protein Atg12p is activated by the E1-like enzyme Atg7p and then transferred to Atg10p, an enzyme with E2-like activity. Atg12p is then constitutively and irreversibly conjugated to Atg5p, which is the only Atg12p target. After Atg12p-Atg5p conjugation, Atg16p associates with the conjugate, resulting in a ~350kDa complex. It is hypothesized that the role of Atg16p in this complex is to properly localize the Atp12p-Atg5p conjugate, which acts as an E3-like enzyme in the Atg8 conjugation system. In the Atg8 system, the other autophagic ubiquitin-like protein Atg8p is first cleaved at its C-terminal end by the cysteine protease Atg4p, which is structurally similar to deubiquitinating enzymes. The proteolytically processed form of Atg8p is then activated by Atg7p and transferred to Atg3p, another E2-like enzyme. Finally, Atg8p is conjugated to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine, a reaction stimulated by the E3-like activity from the Atg5p-Atg12p complex. Atg8p-PE conjugation is reversible; deconjugation is mediated by Atg4p and interferes with membrane fusion.about the Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingpathway Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingis a constitutive and specific form of autophagy that uses autophagosomal-like vesicles for selective transport of hydrolases aminopeptidase Iand alpha-mannosidaseto the vacuole.

Atg10p functions after Atg7p, which mediates Atg12p activation; activated Atg12p is then transferred to Atg10p, forming an Atg12p-Atg10p thioester, in preparation for conjugation to Atg5p. In addition to the usual phenotypes exhibited by atg null mutants, atg10 null mutants are unable to generate Atg12p-Atg5p conjugates, though the conjugation of Atg8p to PE is not affected.

Atg11p dissociates from the Cvt complex and is recycled at some unknown point before vesicle completion. Atg11p is also required for the recruitment of other proteins to the PAS during Cvt vesicle formation and for Atg9p anterograde transport from the mitochondria to the PAS. Atg11p also self-associates, in a manner negatively regulated by the Atg1p kinase, but the function of these homo-dimers/homo-oligomers are yet unknown. atg11 mutant strains are defective in Cvt vesicle formation and sporulation, and have shortened telomeres.

Conjugation is mediated by an isopeptide bond between C-terminal Gly186 of Atg12p and Lys149 of Atg5p, and the conjugates localize to the pre-autophagosomal structure in a manner dependent upon their interaction with Atg16p.  Although Atg12p has no apparent sequence homology to ubiquitin, the carboxy-terminal region of Atg12p is predicted to fold into a ubiquitin-like structure, and this region is sufficient for conjugation and autophagy. Mutant analysis of two residues in this region points to its importance: mutation of Tyr149 affects formation of Atg5p-Atg12p conjugates, while mutation of residue Phe154severely reduces formation of Atg8p-PE conjugates and thus autophagosome formation, probably by preventing formation of the Atg12p-Atg5p.Atg16p complex.  Human ATG12 protein becomes covalently attached to the human ATG5 homolog by a mechanism similar to that used by S. cerevisiae. In mouse cells, this conjugate has been shown to be required for elongation of the isolation membrane to form a complete autophagosome.about autophagy nomenclature The initial identification of factors involved in autophagy was carried out by several independent labs, which led to a proliferation of nomenclature for the genes and gene products involved.

Autophagy is a highly conserved eukaryotic pathway for sequestering and transporting bulk cytoplasm, including proteins and organelle material, to the lysosome for degradation. Upon starvation for nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and various amino acids, or upon endoplasmic reticulum stress, cells initiate formation of a double-membrane vesicle, termed an autophagosome, that mediates this process. Approximately 30 autophagy-relatedproteins have been identified in S. cerevisiae, 17 of which are essential for formation of the autophagosome. Null mutations in most of these genes prevent induction of autophagy, and cells do not survive nutrient starvation; however, these mutants are viable in rich medium. Some of the Atg proteins are also involved in a constitutive biosynthetic process termed the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingpathway, which uses autophagosomal-like vesicles for selective transport of hydrolases aminopeptidase Iand alpha-mannosidaseto the vacuole.

Second, signals generated by the sensors are transmitted to the autophagosome-generating machinery comprised of the 17 Atg gene products. These 17 proteins collectively form the pre-autophagosomal structure/phagophore assembly site. The PAS generates an isolation membrane, which expands and eventually fuses along the edges to complete autophagosome formation. At the vacuole the outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the vacuolar membrane and autophagic bodies are released, disintegrated, and their contents degraded for reuse in biosynthesis.about the Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingpathway Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingis a constitutive and specific form of autophagy that uses autophagosomal-like vesicles for selective transport of hydrolases aminopeptidase Iand alpha-mannosidaseto the vacuole. Unlike autophagy, which is primarily a catabolic process, Cvt is a biosynthetic process. Like autophagosomes, Cvt vesicles form at a structure known as the phagophore assembly site. The PAS structure generates an isolation membrane, which expands and eventually fuses along the edges to complete vesicle formation. At the vacuole, the outer membrane of the Cvt vesicle fuses with the vacuolar membrane, the vesicle is degraded, and the cargos are released and processed into their mature forms by vacuolar peptidases. The Cvt pathway has not been observed outside of yeast, and enzymes specifically involved in this pathway are not well conserved in other organisms.about ATG14 ATG14 encodes the autophagy-specific subunit of phosphatidylinositol3-kinase complex I. Other members of this complex include Vps30p; the PtdIns 3-kinase Vps34p; and Vps15p, a regulatory kinase that tethers the complexes to membranes and activates Vps34p activity. Atg14p acts as a connector between Vps30p and the rest of the complex and is responsible for targeting the entire complex to the PAS. Atg14p is also required for proper localization of Atg2p, Atg8p and the Atg5p-Atg12p.Atg16p complex to the PAS. The PAS localization of Atg14p is itself dependent on other autophagy proteins such as Atg9p, Atg13p, and Atg17p. The expression of ATG14 is induced >20-fold upon nitrogen starvation or rapamycin treatment via regulation by the GATA transcription factor Gln3p. However, based on overexpression experiments, while ATG14 transcriptional regulation contributes to the control of autophagy, induction of ATG14 transcription is not sufficient to induce autophagy under starvation conditions. atg14 mutants are defective in autophagy, the Cvt pathway, sporulation, and survival under starvation conditions. Atg14p homologs have been identified among close relatives of S. cerevisiae and in humans, but the sequence identity between homologs is extremely low.about autophagy nomenclature The initial identification of factors involved in autophagy was carried out by several independent labs, which led to a proliferation of nomenclature for the genes and gene products involved.

Atg15p is a glycosylated protein containing a functional domain that is conserved among lipases and esterases. Atg15p is transported from the ER to the vacuole via the multivesicular bodypathway and is eventually degraded by vacuolar proteinase A. atg15 mutants fail to degrade autophagic, Cvt, and intravacuolar MVB vesicles, show a decrease in their total protein turnover rate, and are defective in sporulation.

At the vacuole the outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the vacuolar membrane and autophagic bodies are released, disintegrated, and their contents degraded for reuse in biosynthesis.about autophagic ubiquitin-like conjugation Formation of autophagosomes requires a number of autophagy proteins that are involved in one of two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, the Atg12 and Atg8 systems. The final product of these two systems is a lipidated form of Atg8p that appears to be required for membrane tethering and hemifusion, which are essential for autophagosome formation. In the Atg12 system, the ubiquitin-like protein Atg12p is activated by the E1-like enzyme Atg7p and then transferred to Atg10p, an enzyme with E2-like activity. Atg12p is then constitutively and irreversibly conjugated to Atg5p, which is the only Atg12p target. After Atg12p-Atg5p conjugation, Atg16p associates with the conjugate, resulting in a ~350kDa complex. It is hypothesized that the role of Atg16p in this complex is to properly localize the Atp12p-Atg5p conjugate, which acts as an E3-like enzyme in the Atg8 conjugation system. In the Atg8 system, the other autophagic ubiquitin-like protein Atg8p is first cleaved at its C-terminal end by the cysteine protease Atg4p, which is structurally similar to deubiquitinating enzymes. The proteolytically processed form of Atg8p is then activated by Atg7p and transferred to Atg3p, another E2-like enzyme. Finally, Atg8p is conjugated to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine, a reaction stimulated by the E3-like activity from the Atg5p-Atg12p complex. Atg8p-PE conjugation is reversible; deconjugation is mediated by Atg4p and interferes with membrane fusion.about the Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingpathway Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingis a constitutive and specific form of autophagy that uses autophagosomal-like vesicles for selective transport of hydrolases aminopeptidase Iand alpha-mannosidaseto the vacuole.

The Cvt pathway has not been observed outside of yeast, and enzymes specifically involved in this pathway are not well conserved in other organisms.about ATG16  Atg16p is a coiled-coil protein that interacts with Atg12p-conjugated Atg5p, and less preferentially with the unconjugated form of Atg5p. Atg16p functions to cross-link Atg5p molecules into Atg12p-Atg5p-Atg16p multimers that are required for autophagy. Interaction with Atg5p occurs via the N-terminal regionof Atg16p, and self assembly of Atg5p-bound Atg16p occurs through the C-terminalcoiled-coil motif. Atg12p-Atg5p-Atg16p multimers form in the cytosol and localize to the PAS. Structural analysis indicates that the interaction between Atg5p and Atg16p is required for localization of Atg16p to the PAS.  In addition to directing localization of Atg5p, Atg16p interaction with Atg5p-Atg12p conjugates is also required to maintain normal levels of Atg8p-PE conjugates under starvation conditions. In a null atg16 mutant unconjugated Atg8p, but not Atg8p-PE, accumulates during starvation. Atg16p homologs have been found in many fungi, in Arabidopsis, and in humans.about autophagy nomenclature The initial identification of factors involved in autophagy was carried out by several independent labs, which led to a proliferation of nomenclature for the genes and gene products involved.

Atg17p has many interaction partners and may form complexes with proteins such as Atg20p, Snx4p, Atg29p, Cis1p, and Atg11p to localize other factors to the PAS. Efficient localization of Atg17p to the PAS is itself dependent on the EPS15 homology domain proteins Irs4p and Tax4p. Atg17p, along with Atg13p, is also a regulatory subunit of the Atg1p protein kinase complex and is required for vesicle expansion during autophagy. Atg13p and Atg17p stimulate Atg1p kinase activity and formation of this complex is specific to autophagy and enhanced during starvation. atg17 mutants are defective in autophagy, blocked in pexophagy, have lengthened telomeres, and cannot survive under starvation conditions. Autophagosomes in atg17 null mutants are fewer in number and less than half the normal size. Overexpression of ATG17 inhibits filamentous growth.

Atg18p is essential for vesicle formation in both autophagy and the Cvt pathway. Atg21p is only required for vesicle formation in the Cvt pathwaybut may have some role in autophagic fidelity. Atg18p and Atg21p are WD-40 repeat proteins, expected to fold as seven bladed &#946;-propellers, that are able to bind both phosphatidylinositol-bisphosphateP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. Atg18p localizes to both the preautophagosomal structureand to punctate structures at the vacuolar membrane. Localization to these two structures may involve a mechanism that depends on differential phosphatidylinositide binding: PtdIns3P to the PAS and PtdInsP2 to the vacuolar membrane. Vacuolar localization of Atg18p is also dependent on the transmembrane protein Vac7p. PAS-localized Atg18p is involved in localization of the autophagy proteins Atg2p and Atg9p. Vacuolar Atg18p is required for retrograde trafficking from the vacuole to the late endosomeas well as regulating the activity of the phosphatidylinositol-phosphate 5-kinase Fab1p which affects PtdInsP2 levels and vacuolar morphology. atg18 null strains have enlarged vacuoles and high levels of PtdInsP2; they are unable to sporulate and unable to grow on media containing glycerol as the sole carbon source. Atg18p and Atg21p have also been shown to interact with the transcriptional activator Rtg3p and null atg18 or atg21 mutations result in the reduced expression of RTG-regulated genes. WD-repeat proteins are conserved from yeast to man, and ATG18 homologs have been identified in organisms such as Drosophilaand human.

Atg19p binds to unprocessed, pro-forms of aminopeptidase I and alpha-mannosidase and brings them to the preautophagosomal structure, the origin of both autophagic and Cvt vesicles. PAS localization is dependent on Atg19p interactions with Atg11p, the Cvt adapter protein, and Atg8p, a ubiquitin-like protein which appears to be required for membrane tethering and hemifusion. Atg19p is incorporated, along with the cargo, into the Cvt vesicle and is eventually degraded by vacuolar proteinases. Atg19p is ubiquitinated on two lysine residues, Lysand Lys, and deubiquitinated in a Ubp3p-dependent manner. These post-translational modifications affect cargo affinity, and both ubiquitination and deubiquitination are required for full Atg19p activity. atg19 deletion mutants are defective in Cvt vesicle formation, and overexpression of ATG19 inhibits filamentous growth. ATG19 homologs have only been identified in other Saccharomyces species and conservation is very low ("},{"body" : "about autophagy...

Some of the Atg proteins are also involved in a constitutive biosynthetic process termed the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingpathway, which uses autophagosomal-like vesicles for selective transport of hydrolases aminopeptidase Iand alpha-mannosidaseto the vacuole.  Autophagy proceeds via a multistep pathwaykindly provided by Dan Klionsky). First, nutrient availability is sensed by the TORC1 complex and also cooperatively by protein kinase A and Sch9p. Second, signals generated by the sensors are transmitted to the autophagosome-generating machinery comprised of the 17 Atg gene products. These 17 proteins collectively form the pre-autophagosomal structure/phagophore assembly site. The PAS generates an isolation membrane, which expands and eventually fuses along the edges to complete autophagosome formation. At the vacuole the outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the vacuolar membrane and autophagic bodies are released, disintegrated, and their contents degraded for reuse in biosynthesis.about the Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingpathway Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingis a constitutive and specific form of autophagy that uses autophagosomal-like vesicles for selective transport of hydrolases aminopeptidase Iand alpha-mannosidaseto the vacuole. Unlike autophagy, which is primarily a catabolic process, Cvt is a biosynthetic process. Like autophagosomes, Cvt vesicles form at a structure known as the phagophore assembly site. The PAS structure generates an isolation membrane, which expands and eventually fuses along the edges to complete vesicle formation. At the vacuole, the outer membrane of the Cvt vesicle fuses with the vacuolar membrane, the vesicle is degraded, and the cargos are released and processed into their mature forms by vacuolar peptidases. The Cvt pathway has not been observed outside of yeast, and enzymes specifically involved in this pathway are not well conserved in other organisms.about ATG21 ATG18 and ATG21 are paralogous genes that, along with HSV2, encode members of a vacuolar/perivacuolar family of phosphoinositide binding proteins. Atg18p is essential for vesicle formation in both autophagy and the Cvt pathway. Atg21p is only required for vesicle formation in the Cvt pathwaybut may have some role in autophagic fidelity. Atg18p and Atg21p are WD-40 repeat proteins, expected to fold as seven bladed &#946;-propellers, that are able to bind both phosphatidylinositol-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. Atg21p localizes to vacuolar and perivacuolar structures at the vertices of the vacuole junctions. Loss of Atg21p activity results in decreased Atg8p-lipid conjugation as well as loss of Atg8p and Atg5p recruitment to the preautophagosomal structure. atg21 null strains are also unable to grow on media containing glycerol as the sole carbon sourceand homozygous diploid null mutants show a decrease in sporulation rate. Atg18p and Atg21p have also been shown to interact with the transcriptional activator Rtg3p, and null atg18 or atg21 mutations result in the reduced expression of RTG-regulated genes. WD-repeat proteins are conserved from yeast to man, and ATG18 and ATG21 homologs have been identified in organisms such as Drosophilaand human. Aberrant expression of human WIPI genes has been found in various cancerous tissues.about autophagy nomenclature The initial identification of factors involved in autophagy was carried out by several independent labs, which led to a proliferation of nomenclature for the genes and gene products involved. The differing gene name acronyms from these groups included APG, AUT, CVT, GSA, PAG, PAZ, and PDD. A concerted effort was made in 2003 by the scientists working in the field to unify the nomenclature for these genes, and AuTophaGy-related genes are now denoted by the letters ATG. In addition to the ATG gene names that have been assigned to S. cerevisiae proteins and their orthologs, several ATG gene names, including ATG25, ATG28, and ATG30, have been used to designate proteins in other ascomycete yeast species for which there is no identifiable equivalent in S. cerevisiae."},{"body" : "about autophagy...  Autophagy is a highly conserved eukaryotic pathway for sequestering and transporting bulk cytoplasm, including proteins and organelle material, to the lysosome for degradation. Upon starvation for nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and various amino acids, or upon endoplasmic reticulum stress, cells initiate formation of a double-membrane vesicle, termed an autophagosome, that mediates this process. Approximately 30 autophagy-relatedproteins have been identified in S. cerevisiae, 17 of which are essential for formation of the autophagosome.

At the vacuole the outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the vacuolar membrane and autophagic bodies are released, disintegrated, and their contents degraded for reuse in biosynthesis.about ATG22  ATG22 encodes a vacuolar integral membrane protein that functions as an amino acid efflux pump for leucine, a function necessary for cell viability during starvation. Atg22p efflux function is required at the last stages of autophagy, when autophagic body breakdown products are recycled to the cytosol. Atg22p is partially redundant in function with vacuolar efflux proteins Avt3p and Avt4p.  Earlier research suggested that the starved atg22 null mutant is defective in breakdown of autophagic bodies that have reached the vacuole. More recent evidence shows that breakdown occurs normally but is delayed. This delay is likely an indirect effect of the mutant defect in recycling amino acids that accumulate in the vacuole back into the cytosol upon autophagic body breakdown. Inappropriate accumulation of these amino acids is thought to affect expression of genes encoding proteins involved in autophagic body breakdown, leading to the apparent delay in breakdown.  ATG22 expression increases in response to nitrogen starvation. Proteins with varying degrees of similarity to Atg22p are found in most yeast species and filamentous fungi but not in higher eukaryotes.about autophagy nomenclature The initial identification of factors involved in autophagy was carried out by several independent labs, which led to a proliferation of nomenclature for the genes and gene products involved.

The Cvt pathway has not been observed outside of yeast, and enzymes specifically involved in this pathway are not well conserved in other organisms.about ATG23  Atg23p function is essential for the Cvt pathway, but not for the related process of autophagy. An atg23 null mutant is defective for maturation of proaminopeptidase I, indicating a defect in Cvt pathway function, but can perform autophagy, albeit with reduced efficiency relative to wild-type cells.  Atg23p is a peripheral membrane protein that localizes to the phagophore assembly siteas well as to non-PAS cytoplasmic sites, in both nutrient-rich and starvation conditions. Atg23p cycles between these locations and does not remain associated with the completed Cvt vesicle; rather, it is retrieved for reuse. Anterograde movement of Atg23p to the PAS requires Atg27p and Atg9p, and retrograde movement from the PAS requires the Atg1p-Atg13p complex. Atg23p is also required for similar cycling of Atg9p and Atg27p between these locations; moreover, the three proteins form a complex in which Atg23p and Atg27p both interact directly with Atg9p but not with each other.  Atg23p is not widely conserved and appears to be found only in species closely related to S. cerevisiae.about autophagy nomenclature The initial identification of factors involved in autophagy was carried out by several independent labs, which led to a proliferation of nomenclature for the genes and gene products involved.

Atg27p acts as a downstream effector of the PtdIns 3-kinase Vps34p, and is able to bind 3-phosphoinositide although it does not contain a known binding motif. In 2003, a correction to the ATG27 sequence resulted in a shift of the start site 225bpupstream. This extension of the protein changed the predicted transmembrane topology from that of a type II transmembrane protein, as originally reported, to that of a type I protein. Atg27p shuttles between the PAS, the mitochondria, and the Golgi complex. Atg27 anterograde cycling to the PAS requires Atg9p, Atg11p, and Atg23p, while retrograde cycling from the PAS to the mitochondria/Golgi requires the Atg1p-Atg13p complex, Atg2p, and Atg18p. Atg27p is also involved in the anterograde movement of Atg9p from the mitochondria to the PAS, resulting in reciprocal dependency of anterograde cycling of these two proteins. atg27 mutants are defective in autophagy, Cvt transport, and pexophagy. ATG27 homologs have been identified in all yeast species and filamentous fungi studied to date, but no ATG27 ortholog has yet been identified in higher eukaryotes.about autophagy nomenclature The initial identification of factors involved in autophagy was carried out by several independent labs, which led to a proliferation of nomenclature for the genes and gene products involved.

Atg29p interacts with Atg17p, and localization of Atg29p, Atg17p, and Cis1p to the PAS is interdependent. These 3 autophagy-specific proteins and the Atg1p-Atg13p kinase complex are all required for PAS recruitment of other ATG proteins; thus it is proposed that Atg29p, Atg17p, and Cis1p form a complex that functions cooperatively with the Atg1p-Atg13p kinase complex to organize the PAS.  Proteins with similarity to Atg29p have been found in some other yeast species and filamentous fungi, but not in C. albicans, S. pombe, or higher eukaryotes, indicating Atg29p is not widely conserved.about autophagy nomenclature The initial identification of factors involved in autophagy was carried out by several independent labs, which led to a proliferation of nomenclature for the genes and gene products involved.

The final product of these two systems is a lipidated form of Atg8p that appears to be required for membrane tethering and hemifusion, which are essential for autophagosome formation. In the Atg12 system, the ubiquitin-like protein Atg12p is activated by the E1-like enzyme Atg7p and then transferred to Atg10p, an enzyme with E2-like activity. Atg12p is then constitutively and irreversibly conjugated to Atg5p, which is the only Atg12p target. After Atg12p-Atg5p conjugation, Atg16p associates with the conjugate, resulting in a ~350kDa complex. It is hypothesized that the role of Atg16p in this complex is to properly localize the Atp12p-Atg5p conjugate, which acts as an E3-like enzyme in the Atg8 conjugation system. In the Atg8 system, the other autophagic ubiquitin-like protein Atg8p is first cleaved at its C-terminal end by the cysteine protease Atg4p, which is structurally similar to deubiquitinating enzymes. The proteolytically processed form of Atg8p is then activated by Atg7p and transferred to Atg3p, another E2-like enzyme. Finally, Atg8p is conjugated to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine, a reaction stimulated by the E3-like activity from the Atg5p-Atg12p complex. Atg8p-PE conjugation is reversible; deconjugation is mediated by Atg4p and interferes with membrane fusion.about the Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingpathway Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingis a constitutive and specific form of autophagy that uses autophagosomal-like vesicles for selective transport of hydrolases aminopeptidase Iand alpha-mannosidaseto the vacuole.

Overexpression of ATG3 inhibits filamentous growth. ATG3 is highly conserved, and homologs have been identified in organisms such as soil amoeba, Drosophila, rat, and human.about autophagy nomenclature The initial identification of factors involved in autophagy was carried out by several independent labs, which led to a proliferation of nomenclature for the genes and gene products involved.

Atg4p has been shown to interact with Tub1p and Tub2p; this interaction is thought to be important for the attachment of autophagosomes to microtubules.  Atg4p is conserved in higher eukaryotes.

Autophagy proceeds via a multistep pathwaykindly provided by Dan Klionsky). First, nutrient availability is sensed by the TORC1 complex and also cooperatively by protein kinase A and Sch9p. Second, signals generated by the sensors are transmitted to the autophagosome-generating machinery comprised of the 17 Atg gene products. These 17 proteins collectively form the pre-autophagosomal structure/phagophore assembly site. The PAS generates an isolation membrane, which expands and eventually fuses along the edges to complete autophagosome formation. At the vacuole the outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the vacuolar membrane and autophagic bodies are released, disintegrated, and their contents degraded for reuse in biosynthesis.about autophagic ubiquitin-like conjugation Formation of autophagosomes requires a number of autophagy proteins that are involved in one of two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, the Atg12 and Atg8 systems. The final product of these two systems is a lipidated form of Atg8p that appears to be required for membrane tethering and hemifusion, which are essential for autophagosome formation. In the Atg12 system, the ubiquitin-like protein Atg12p is activated by the E1-like enzyme Atg7p and then transferred to Atg10p, an enzyme with E2-like activity. Atg12p is then constitutively and irreversibly conjugated to Atg5p, which is the only Atg12p target. After Atg12p-Atg5p conjugation, Atg16p associates with the conjugate, resulting in a ~350kDa complex. It is hypothesized that the role of Atg16p in this complex is to properly localize the Atp12p-Atg5p conjugate, which acts as an E3-like enzyme in the Atg8 conjugation system. In the Atg8 system, the other autophagic ubiquitin-like protein Atg8p is first cleaved at its C-terminal end by the cysteine protease Atg4p, which is structurally similar to deubiquitinating enzymes. The proteolytically processed form of Atg8p is then activated by Atg7p and transferred to Atg3p, another E2-like enzyme. Finally, Atg8p is conjugated to the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine, a reaction stimulated by the E3-like activity from the Atg5p-Atg12p complex. Atg8p-PE conjugation is reversible; deconjugation is mediated by Atg4p and interferes with membrane fusion.about the Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingpathway Cytoplasm-to-vacuole targetingis a constitutive and specific form of autophagy that uses autophagosomal-like vesicles for selective transport of hydrolases aminopeptidase Iand alpha-mannosidaseto the vacuole. Unlike autophagy, which is primarily a catabolic process, Cvt is a biosynthetic process. Like autophagosomes, Cvt vesicles form at a structure known as the phagophore assembly site. The PAS structure generates an isolation membrane, which expands and eventually fuses along the edges to complete vesicle formation. At the vacuole, the outer membrane of the Cvt vesicle fuses with the vacuolar membrane, the vesicle is degraded, and the cargos are released and processed into their mature forms by vacuolar peptidases. The Cvt pathway has not been observed outside of yeast, and enzymes specifically involved in this pathway are not well conserved in other organisms.about ATG5  Most of the cellular Atg5p and Atg12p exist as Atg12-Atg5 conjugates, even when autophagy has not been induced. Conjugation occurs through an isopeptide bond between C-terminal Gly186 of Atg12p and Lys149 of Atg5p, and the conjugates localize to the pre-autophagosomal structure in a manner dependent upon interaction with Atg16p.  Null homozygous atg5 diploids exhibit a sporulation defect. A temperature-sensitive mutation in ATG5 affects import of aminopeptidase I to the vacuole, indicating that Atg5p is involved in the Cvt pathway.Atg5p is conserved in nature, and human Atg5p becomes covalently attached to the human Atg12p homolog by a mechanism similar to that used by yeast. In mouse cells, this conjugate has been shown to be required for elongation of the isolation membrane to form a complete autophagosome. Studies in mammalian cells also suggest that human Atg5p may function as a molecular switch between autophagy, which promotes cell survival, and apoptosis, a process of cell death that can be activated when autophagic activity is high.about autophagy nomenclature The initial identification of factors involved in autophagy was carried out by several independent labs, which led to a proliferation of nomenclature for the genes and gene products involved. The differing gene name acronyms from these groups included APG, AUT, CVT, GSA, PAG, PAZ, and PDD. A concerted effort was made in 2003 by the scientists working in the field to unify the nomenclature for these genes, and AuTophaGy-related genes are now denoted by the letters ATG. In addition to the ATG gene names that have been assigned to S. cerevisiae proteins and their orthologs, several ATG gene names, including ATG25, ATG28, and ATG30, have been used to designate proteins in other ascomycete yeast species for which there is no identifiable equivalent in S. cerevisiae."},{"body" : "about autophagy...  Autophagy is a highly conserved eukaryotic pathway for sequestering and transporting bulk cytoplasm, including proteins and organelle material, to the lysosome for degradation. Upon starvation for nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and various amino acids, or upon endoplasmic reticulum stress, cells initiate formation of a double-membrane vesicle, termed an autophagosome, that mediates this process. Approximately 30 autophagy-relatedproteins have been identified in S. cerevisiae, 17 of which are essential for formation of the autophagosome.

The Cvt pathway has not been observed outside of yeast, and enzymes specifically involved in this pathway are not well conserved in other organisms.about ATG7  Atg7p is primarily a cytoplasmic protein but interaction with Atg12p leads to its association with membranes. Atg7p, which is involved in autophagy, the Cvt pathway, and peroxisome degradation, functions in a manner similar to the ubiquitin-activating E1 enzyme Uba1p. Moreover, the region spanning residues 322-392 has significant homology to a region of Uba1p and contains an ATP-binding domainthat is essential for the conjugation reaction. Atg7p binds to and thus activates Atg12p via a thioester bond between the C-terminal Gly186 of Atg12p and Cys507 of Atg7p. Atg7p activates Atg8p via a similar type of bond between the C-terminal glycine of Atg8p and Cys507.  Null atg7 mutants lack autophagic bodies, do not form the Atg12p-Atg5p conjugate, and fail to properly import the vacuolar hydrolase aminopeptidase Iby the Cvt pathway. Overexpression of ATG7 in nitrogen stress conditions inhibits the filamentous growth response normally exhibited by cells. Atg7p function in autophagy and the Cvt pathways requires the C-terminal 17 amino acids; removal of these residues prevents lipidation of Atg8p but has no effect on Atg12p-Atg5p conjugation or Atg7p homodimerization.  The human homolog of ATG7, APG7L, interacts with human ATG12 and has E1-like activity similar to the yeast homolog. Studies in mice reveal that loss of ATG7 in the central nervous system leads to neurodegeneration.about autophagy nomenclature The initial identification of factors involved in autophagy was carried out by several independent labs, which led to a proliferation of nomenclature for the genes and gene products involved.

The Cvt pathway has not been observed outside of yeast, and enzymes specifically involved in this pathway are not well conserved in other organisms.about ATG8  Atg8p is required for both the Cvt and autophagy pathways; Atg8p plays a role in expansion of the phagophore during autophagosome formation, and levels of Atg8p determine the size of the autophagosome. While most of the Atg8p-PE is released during formation of autophagosomes, a portion remains associated with the completed structure and thus serves as an experimental marker for these structures. ATG8 gene expression is induced at least 10-fold in response to starvation, with mRNA levels peaking after about 30 minutes. Starvation causes localization of the protein to shift from small cytoplasmic structures to the isolation membranes of nascent autophagosomes, where Atg8p appears to promote the fusion of these membranes necessary for autophagosome formation. The change in Atg8p localization requires functional Atg4p, Atg7p, Atg3p, and the carboxy terminal glycine of Atg8p, all of which are required to mediate the conjugation of Atg8p to PE through an amide bond between the C-terminal glycine and the amino group of PE. Atg4p cleaves this amide bond, effectively releasing some of the Atg8p from the autophagosome, an important step in maturation of the structure. Null atg8 mutations severely impair formation of autophagosomes.  Atg8p in mammals is a multigene family, consisting of GATE16, GABARAP, and LC3. Crystal structure studies indicate that Atg8p homologs consist of an N-terminal helical domain and a C-terminal ubiqutin-like domain.about autophagy nomenclature The initial identification of factors involved in autophagy was carried out by several independent labs, which led to a proliferation of nomenclature for the genes and gene products involved.

The Cvt pathway has not been observed outside of yeast, and enzymes specifically involved in this pathway are not well conserved in other organisms.about ATG9  Atg9p is required for both the bulk autophagy and Cvt pathways and is directly involved in formation of the sequestering vesicle. Atg9p is an integral membrane protein that localizes to the PAS and to smaller punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm and on the surface of mitochondria. Atg9p cycles between these locations by a process that allows it to remain associated with lipid bilayers. These findings have led to hypotheses that Atg9p may serve as a membrane carrier, and that mitochondria may be a membrane source, for the formation of the pre-autophagosome. Shuttling occurs whether the cells are maintained in conditions in which the Cvt pathway is operativeor in conditions that promote autophagy.  Anterograde transport of Atg9p to the PAS is facilitated by Atg11p, Atg23p, and Atg27p; Atg23p and Atg27p also localize to punctate structures and the PAS and have been shown to form a complex with Atg9p. Atg9p is not a component of completed autophagosomes, and retrograde transport from the PAS back to its mitochondrial and cytoplasmic locations is mediated by a general process that requires the Atg1p-Atg13p complex, Atg2p, Atg18p, and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase complex I.  Atg9p homologs have been found in other organisms including plants and humans. The mammalian homolog, mAtg9, exhibits a different subcellular distribution from S. cerevisiae Atg9p: it localizes to the trans-Golgi network and to late endosomes. Starvation conditions that upregulate autophagy cause mAtg9 to redistribute to peripheral, endosomal membranes, which are autophagosomal intermediates.about autophagy nomenclature The initial identification of factors involved in autophagy was carried out by several independent labs, which led to a proliferation of nomenclature for the genes and gene products involved.

PKA activity regulates processes involved in cell growth and response to nutrients and stress. In the absence of cAMP, Bcy1p inhibits PKA activity by forming an inactive heterotetrameric complex with the PKA catalytic subunits, in which two regulatory subunits bind to two catalytic subunits. In the presence of cAMP, binding of cAMP to Bcy1p causes its dissociation from the complex as a homodimer, releasing the catalytic subunits as two active monomer. PKA is able to phosphorylate its own regulatory subunit, and the phosphorylation state of Bcy1p has been shown to affect its affinity for the PKA catalytic subunits. Phosphorylation of Bcy1p by other kinases, such as Yak1p and Mck1p, affects its cellular localization. External stimuliresult in these kinases phosphorylating an N-terminal localization domain in Bcy1p, and the phosphorylated form of Bcy1p translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via an interaction with the protein Zds1p. Bcy1p function is independent of its location, but the relocalization of Bcy1p to the cytoplasm may serve to recruit PKA to a specific subset of target proteins.

The first three cleavages at A0, A1, and A2are essential for production of the 18S rRNA and the 40S small ribosomal subunit, but mutations which interfere with these cleavages have little effect on production of the 60S large ribosomal subunit. These three early cleavages occur in a series of large U3-associated ribonucleoprotein complexesand require base pairing of the U3 snoRNA with sequences in the 5-ETS and the 18S rRNA. Click on the following figure for more details about the rDNA repeat and cleavage sites within the rRNA transcript:About the 90S preribosome and SSU processome complexes A number of U3-containing early ribosome assembly and rRNA processing complexes have been identified that contain the 35S pre-rRNA transcript and have overlapping but not identical protein compositions. Both the 90S preribosome and the small subunitprocessome complexes contain ribosomal proteins, primarily of the small subunit, and non-ribosomal proteins presumably involved in rRNA processing and assembly of the small 40S ribsomal subunit. While many proteins are found in both complexes, some are found in only one or the other. It may be that the 90S preribosome and SSU processome complexes are both intermediates in a series of complexes leading to the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit, or it may be that the SSU processome lies on an alternate assembly pathway. The 90S preribosome complex is described as corresponding to the earliest detectable rRNA processing and ribosome assembly complex.

The t-UTP subcomplex is also found as part of the SSU processome complex, which is slightly smaller at 80S. Depletion of any of the members of the t-UTP subcomplex results in decreased transcription of rDNA leading to decreased levels of the primary 35S rRNA transcript. In contrast, mutation or depletion of most other members of either the 90S preribosome or SSU processome complexes causes decreased 18S rRNA levels without affecting the levels of the 25S or 5.8S rRNAs.Non-ribosomal protein components of the 90S preribosome and SSU processome Subunits of both the 90S preribosomeand SSU processomeinclude: Bud21p, Dip2p, Ecm16p, Emg1p, Imp3p, Imp4p, Krr1p, Mpp10p, Nan1p, Noc4p, Nop1p, Nop14p, Nop58p, Pwp2p, Rrp5p, Rrp9p, Nop56p, Sof1p, Utp4p, Utp6p, Utp7p, Utp8p, Utp9p, Utp10p, Utp13p, Utp15p, Utp18p, Utp20p, Utp21p, and Utp22p  Additional subunits of the 90S preribosomeinclude: Bfr2p, Bms1p, Cbf5p, Cms1p, Dbp8p, Dim1p, Enp1p, Enp2p, Has1p, Kre33p, Mrd1p, Nop9p, Pno1p, Prp43p, Rcl1p, Rok1p, Rrp12p, Scl1p, Slx9p, Tsr1p, and Utp30p  Additional subunits of the SSU processomeinclude: Fcf1p, Utp23p, Sas10p, Snu13p, Utp5p, Utp11p, and Utp14p"},{"body" : "BGL2 encodes an endo-beta-1,3-glucanase that is abundant in the yeast cell wall; it introduces intrachain 1,6-beta linkages into 1,3-beta glucan, contributing to the rigid structure of the cell wall.

Bir1p contains three baculovirus IAP repeat domains, a protein motif which is usually found in inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins, and Bir1p appears to play independent roles in chromosome stability and apoptosis.In S. cerevisiae, Ipl1p function is specifically required at many distinct locations and events during cell division. Ipl1p localizes to kinetochores from G1 to metaphase and to the spindle after metaphase. During chromosome segregation, Aurora kinase ensures chromosome bi-orientation by promoting turnover of connections between kinetochores and spindle pole bodies until the movement of sister kinetochores toward opposite spindle poles creates tension. If tension defects arise, Aurora kinase activity creates unattached kinetochores and activates the spindle assembly checkpoint. Ipl1p relocalizes to the spindle midzone  in late anaphase, where it ensures that cytokinesis completes only after all chromosomes have migrated to the poles. Ipl1p is also required for mitotic spindle disassembly, and during this process Ipl1p localizes to the plus ends of the depolymerizing spindle microtubules. The dynamic localization of the Aurora kinase complex is a carefully regulated process. For example, it has been demonstrated that movement of the complex from the kinetochores to the spindle is regulated by dephosphorylation of a non-catalytic member of the Aurora kinase complex, Sli15p, by Cdc14p. The primary regulator of Aurora Kinase activity, type 1 protein phosphastase Glc7p, acts in opposition to Aurora kinase by dephosphorylating Ipl1p targets, rather than by directly regulating Ipl1p. Demonstrated Ipl1p phosphorylation targets include: kinetochore components Cbf2p, Mif2p and Tid3p; proteins required for spindle assembly or integrity such as Ase1p, Mad3p and Dam1p; condensin; Histone H3; and Aurora Kinase complex component, Sli15p.There are three Aurora kinase family members in Homo sapiens:, which vary in function and tissue specificity. Aurora kinases have been implicated in tumorigenesis, and Aurora kinase expression levels and activity have been shown to be up-regulated in many human cancers."},{"body" : "BIT61 is a nonessential gene that encodes a subunit of the TOR complex 2.

Fehlker et al. find Blm10p in association with proteasome precursor complexes. Schmidt et al. find that the majority of Blm10p in the cell is found in mature complexes containing both the core particle and the 19S regulatory module as well as Blm10p. They suggest that although most proteasome activators are multisubunit ring-shaped complexes, Blm10p is a large protein that appears to bind to the ring-shaped proteasome core particle as an individual protein.Blm10p is similar to mammalian PA200, a proteasome activator protein which stimulates the degradation of peptides, but not of intact proteins. PA200 is postulated to be involved in DNA repair, though the mechanism by which this may occur is not clear.BLM3 was identified genetically in a large screen looking for mutations conferring hypersensitivity to the drug bleomycin and radiation. The ORF YFL007W was cloned as a multicopy suppressor of the codominant blm3-1 mutation. Complete deletions of the YFL007W ORF indicated that cells are hypersensitive to bleomycin and viable in the absence of the drug. Subsequent resequencing of the region around YFL007W indicated the presence of an additional G, resulting in the original YFL006W ORF being merged into YFL007W. Genetic mapping and sequencing of the expanded YFL007W ORF in the blm3-1 mutant indicated that YFL007W was an extragenic suppressor of the blm3-1 mutation. Thus, YFL007W was renamed BLM10.

The first three cleavages at A0, A1, and A2are essential for production of the 18S rRNA and the 40S small ribosomal subunit, but mutations which interfere with these cleavages have little effect on production of the 60S large ribosomal subunit. These three early cleavages occur in a series of large U3-associated ribonucleoprotein complexesand require base pairing of the U3 snoRNA with sequences in the 5-ETS and the 18S rRNA. Click on the following figure for more details about the rDNA repeat and cleavage sites within the rRNA transcript:About the 90S preribosome and SSU processome complexes A number of U3-containing early ribosome assembly and rRNA processing complexes have been identified that contain the 35S pre-rRNA transcript and have overlapping but not identical protein compositions. Both the 90S preribosome and the small subunitprocessome complexes contain ribosomal proteins, primarily of the small subunit, and non-ribosomal proteins presumably involved in rRNA processing and assembly of the small 40S ribsomal subunit. While many proteins are found in both complexes, some are found in only one or the other. It may be that the 90S preribosome and SSU processome complexes are both intermediates in a series of complexes leading to the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit, or it may be that the SSU processome lies on an alternate assembly pathway. The 90S preribosome complex is described as corresponding to the earliest detectable rRNA processing and ribosome assembly complex. The 90S is itself assembled from a number of stable subcomplexes including the t-UTP subcomplex, the Pwp2p/UTP-B subcomplexwhich interacts directly with the 5-ETS of the 35S pre-rRNA, the UTP-C subcomplex, and the Mpp10 subcomplex. The t-UTP subcomplex is also found as part of the SSU processome complex, which is slightly smaller at 80S. Depletion of any of the members of the t-UTP subcomplex results in decreased transcription of rDNA leading to decreased levels of the primary 35S rRNA transcript. In contrast, mutation or depletion of most other members of either the 90S preribosome or SSU processome complexes causes decreased 18S rRNA levels without affecting the levels of the 25S or 5.8S rRNAs.Non-ribosomal protein components of the 90S preribosome and SSU processome Subunits of both the 90S preribosomeand SSU processomeinclude: Bud21p, Dip2p, Ecm16p, Emg1p, Imp3p, Imp4p, Krr1p, Mpp10p, Nan1p, Noc4p, Nop1p, Nop14p, Nop58p, Pwp2p, Rrp5p, Rrp9p, Nop56p, Sof1p, Utp4p, Utp6p, Utp7p, Utp8p, Utp9p, Utp10p, Utp13p, Utp15p, Utp18p, Utp20p, Utp21p, and Utp22p  Additional subunits of the 90S preribosomeinclude: Bfr2p, Bms1p, Cbf5p, Cms1p, Dbp8p, Dim1p, Enp1p, Enp2p, Has1p, Kre33p, Mrd1p, Nop9p, Pno1p, Prp43p, Rcl1p, Rok1p, Rrp12p, Scl1p, Slx9p, Tsr1p, and Utp30p  Additional subunits of the SSU processomeinclude: Fcf1p, Utp23p, Sas10p, Snu13p, Utp5p, Utp11p, and Utp14p"},{"body" : "About NAD biosynthesis -- de novo and salvage pathways  Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotideis an essential cofactor for cellular redox reactions and energy metabolism.

Formins are a conserved family of proteins that promote the assembly of actin filaments, a function that is necessary for remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton during such processes as budding, mating, cytokinesis, endocytosis, and in higher cells, cell adhesion and migration. The hallmark of formin proteins is the presence of two highly conserved FHdomains: the FH1 domain, containing polyproline motifs that mediate binding to profilin, which in turn binds actin monomers; and the FH2 domain, which nucleates actin assembly. Bni1p and Bnr1p are classified in the diaphanous-related formingroup of metazoan formins, named for the founding Drosophila gene diaphanous. The FH2 domains of Bni1p and Bnr1p are distinct from those of the metazoan groups, containing a yeast-specific insert that is not found in other organisms. In addition to FH1 and FH2 domains, DRFs also contain a regulatory Rho-binding domainand a Dia-autoregulatory-domain. Null mutations in either BNI1 or BNR1 do not impair cell viability, but the double bni1 bnr1 mutant is inviable, indicating that formins play an essential role in S. cerevisiae.  A model for formin-mediated actin assembly proposes the following sequence of events. Activated Rho protein binds to the formin RBD and releases the formin from a conformation in which it is autoinhibited, due to interaction between its amino and carboxy termini, to a conformation that exposes the FH1 and FH2 domains. The FH1 domain interacts with profilin-bound actin monomers, delivering them to the FH2 domain, which is dimeric in structure and thus may interact with two actin monomers to stabilize a dimeric actin form, prior to polymerization to form actin cables. The FH2 domain remains associated with the growing end of the filament to protect it from interaction with capping proteins.Consistent with the model, Bni1p is known to be a downstream target of the small GTPase Rho1p, which regulates reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and hence the process of bud formation. In addition, Bni1p activation is regulated by Rho3p and Rho4p, which affect the inhibitory interaction between the RBD and the DAD domains in the formin, and the Rho protein Cdc42p is needed for proper cable assembly during initiation of bud growth. Bni1p autoinhibition is also disrupted by the action of Prk1p kinase, which phosphorylates Bni1p. Support for the model also comes from crystal structure studies of the Bni1p FH2 domain complexed with actin.  Bni1p functions as a component of the polarisome, a complex that also includes Spa2p, Bud6p, Pea2p, Msb3p, and Msb4p. The polarisome is important for determining cell polarity; it acts as the focal point for polymerization of actin monomers into actin cables, and is required for the proper initiation of bud growth and the proper shape of vegetative buds and mating shmoos.  Localization of Bni1p is dynamic; in small-budded cells Bni1p moves along the bud cortex, becoming more abundant at the bud tip and bud neck as growth proceeds. In addition, Bni1p is found as abundant cytoplasmic speckles throughout the cell cycle; these speckles are associated with actin cables and are not visible upon loss of polymerized actin.  Although bni1 null mutants are viable, they exhibit a shorter replicative lifespan than wild type cells. They are partially deficient in cytokinesis, and homozygous diploids are predominantly round in shape, exhibit a random budding pattern, and are defective for filamentous growth in nitrogen starvation conditions. Null mutants also display reduced mating efficiencies in response to pheromone treatment, and detailed genetic studies indicate Bni1p plays a role in polarized recruitment of Ste5p and the consequent activation of Fus3p during mating response."},{"body" : "BNI4 encodes a scaffold protein that tethers chitin synthase IIIto the bud neck by interacting with septin neck filaments and with Skt5p, which is a regulatory subunit of chitin synthase III.

Bni4p is required for the assembly of the chitin ring, and is also involved in septum formation and the maintenance of bud neck integrity.  Bni4p localization is regulated during the cell cycle, with the protein located on the exterior of the septin ring before budding and on the mother side of the collar after budding. Proper localization of Bni4p requires the actin cytoskeleton, and binding to Glc7p, since cells containing mutant bni4 that fails to associate with Glc7p display mislocalization of Bni4p. Bni4 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, and inactivation of the protein kinase Hsl1p affects Bni4p localization, but there is no evidence that Hsl1p directly phosphorylates Bni4p.  bni4 null mutants are viable, but display altered deposition of chitin, and mislocalization of Chs3p, Skt5p, and Glc7p."},{"body" : "The S. cerevisiae genome encodes two genes that are members of the formin family, BNI1 and BNR1, which assemble linear actin cables in the bud and bud neck, respectively.

Bud14p has also been identified as a regulator of BNR1; Bud14p inhibits the Bnr1p FH2 domain, and displaces Bnr1p from growing ends. Bnr1p localizes exclusively to the bud neck, and localization depends on the bud neck-localized septins Cdc3p, Cdc10p, Cdc11p, Cdc12p, and Shs1p. At this locale, Bnr1p assembles actin cables that extend from the bud neck into the mother cell and therefore help stabilize the mother-bud axis. In vitro experiments have demonstrated that Bnr1p nucleating activity is 10-fold stronger than Bni1p activity, likely due to the fact that Bnr1p has a higher affinity for filament ends than Bni1p; in addition, Bnr1p binds to the sides of actin filaments and bundles them, whereas Bni1p does not.

Rho3p/Rho4p interactions: Overexpression of either Rho3p or Rho4p suppresses the synthetic lethality of the boi1 boi2 mutations. Bem1p interactions: Two-hybrid analysis revealed that the proline-rich region of the Boi proteins mediates the interaction with the second SH3 domain of Bem1p. Expressing the Boi1 protein with mutations in the proline-rich region suppresses boi1 boi2 double mutants as well as boi1 boi2 bem1 triple mutants. Cdc42p interactions: The PH domain of the Boi proteins is necessary and sufficient for function and mediates the interaction with Cdc42p in the two-hybrid system.

TFIIIB, comprised of TBP, Brf1p, and Bdp1p, directs pol III to the transcriptional start site of these genes and is itself recruited to a location immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site by the TFIIIC complex. TFIIIB binds to TFIIIC mainly through contact between TFIIIB subunits Brf1p and Bdp1p and the TFIIIC subunit Tfc4p, and between TBP and the TFIIIC subunit Tfc8p. The TFIIIB footprint on promoter DNA is influenced by the DNA-binding site preferences of the TBP subunit and by the non-histone chromatin proteins Nhp6Ap and Nhp6bp. TFIIIB function is also important for promoter opening, reinitiation of pol III transcription, and targeting and efficiency of Ty3 retrotransposition. TFIIIB is also the target of Maf1-mediated repression of pol III transcription.BRF1 is an essential gene and encodes a structurally bipartite protein. The N-terminal half is similar to the transcription factor TFIIBand the C-terminal half is specific for pol III function and contains the primary interaction sites for the other TFIIIB subunits. Brf1p also functions to dissociate inactive TBP homodimers into active monomers.

Bst1p is also required for proper discrimination between resident ER proteins and Golgi-bound cargo molecules, and is required for the transport of misfolded proteins to the Golgi, though dispensable for the transport of many normal cargo proteins. Bst1p also plays a role in the retrieval to the ER of proteins transported to the Golgi apparatus via COPII-coated vesicles.

Cat8p functions to derepress transcription of target genes by binding to the CSREupstream of these genes. At least some of the genes activated by Cat8p encode additional transcription factors such as Sip4p, which functions in later steps of the derepression process.While glucose regulates transcription of CAT8, it also appears to regulate Cat8p activity; Cat8p is phosphorylated in derepressed cells and addition of glucose triggers dephosphorylation."},{"body" : "During N-linked glycosylation of proteins, oligosaccharide chains are assembled on the carrier molecule dolichyl pyrophosphate in the following order: 2 molecules of N-acetylglucosamine, 9 molecules of mannose, and 3 molecules of glucose.

CDC13/EST4 is one of five genes required for telomerase activity in vivo. EST1, EST2, TLC1 and EST3 are the other four genes. Mutations in any of these five genes leads to progressive telomere shortening, the so-called ever shorter telomeresphenotype and eventually to cell death; however, a complete deletion of CDC13 is inviable. CDC13 is the only essential gene among the EST genes.The N-terminal region of Cdc13p is crucial for the proteins activity due to its various interactions with different binding proteins. The telomere capping function is mediated through its interaction with Stn1p and Ten1p, essential proteins required for telomere length regulation. Cdc13p plays a role in telomere replication through its interactions with the Pol1p catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase alpha, and an essential subunit of telomerase, Est1p. Cdc13p and Est1p also recruit and activate the telomere-bound Est2p catalytic subunit of telomerase for its replication. The telomerase recruitment step is regulated by the yeast ku heterodimer, and Stn1p which impart positive and negative control on the Cdc13p-Est1p interaction. Cdc13p is regulated by the phosphorylation of the SQ/TQ motif in the telomerase recruitment domain by the checkpoint kinases, Mec1p and Tel1p. Mutation in Cdc13p results in abnormal uncapped telomeres with long exposed G-strands leading to activation of the RAD9 DNA damage pathway, cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death.In humans, telomere length is linked to aging and cancer: in human germline cells telomeres are long, whereas in cells of somatic tissues, telomerase activity is absent and the telomeres are short. Upon sufficient shortening, the somatic cells stop dividing and become senescent. Inappropriate telomerase activity is detected in most malignant tumors, and the genes required for telomerase activity are potential targets for cancer therapy. Human orthologs for four of the telomerase subunits are known. Est2p, the telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic enzyme, is similar to TERT, TLC1, the template RNA is similar to TERC/hTR, while Cdc13p shares sequence similarity with human POT1. There are three Est1p like proteins in humans, although only hEST1A and hEST1B have been shown to be associated with the telomerase. A human ortholog for EST3 hasnt been identified.

Cdc14p dephosphorylates key mitotic targets which leads to the coordinated inactivation of mitotic cyclins, proper spindle disassembly, and completion of cytokinesis. During the meiotic cell cycle, Cdc14p has been proposed to coordinate spindle disassembly and the two consecutive chromosome segregation events.During most of the mitotic cell cycle, Cdc14p is kept inactive and sequestered in the nucleolus by Net1p as part of the RENT complex. Two regulatory networks, FEARand MEN, coordinate the stepwise nucleolar release and activation of Cdc14p. Nucleolar release of Cdc14p requires its dissociation from Net1p and inactivation of its nuclear-localization signal via Dbf2p-mediated phosphorylation. Cdc14p first relocates to the spindle pole body during early anaphase and then to the bud neck and cytoplasm during late anaphase. Released from the nucleolus, Cdc14p can dephosphorylate S-phase and M-phase mitotic cyclin substrates to coordinate the metaphase to anaphase transition. The return of Cdc14p to the nucleolus signals the completion of mitosis. Multiple regulatory pathways have been proposed to regulate Cdc14p phosphatase activity during meiosis as well.Cdc14p belongs to a subfamily of dual-specificity protein phosphatases that can dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues.

Genetic studies indicated that MAE1 is the likely candidate for this role. MAE1 encodes malic enzyme which catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate. Indeed, a cdc19 mae1 double deletion mutant cannot grow using ethanol as the sole carbon source. Genetic analysis of CDC19 also showed that it is involved in the cell division cycle; temperature-sensitive cdc19 mutants arrest growth in G1 at the restrictive temperature of 36 degrees C.Overexpression of PYK2, which encodes a second yeast pyruvate kinase, restores growth on glucose to cdc19 mutant cells. However, CDC19 is tightly regulated and activated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatewhereas PYK2 is subject to glucose repression and appears to be insensitive to FBP levels, suggesting that it may be active when FBP levels are too low to activate CDC19. Therefore, PYK1 appears to be the main pyruvate kinase in the glycolytic pathway.Transcription of CDC19 is induced in the presence of glucose; the CDC19 promoter contains binding sites for the transcription factors Rap1p and Abf1p.

In turn, these Ras proteins are activated by the Cdc25p guanine nucleotide-exchange factor, which stimulates Ras1p and Ras2p exchange of GDP for GTP. Through its role in regulating cAMP levels, Cdc25p is involved in the processes of fermentative growth, nonfermentative growth, cell cycling, sporulation, and cell size regulation. CDC25 encodes a 180 kDa plasma membrane-bound protein. The Cdc25p N-terminal domain contains an SH3 motif that binds adenylate cyclase and a cyclin destruction box motif that mediates Cdc25p ubiquitin-dependent degradation. The C-terminal domain includes the catalytic domain and a membrane localization signal. The Cdc25p C-terminus is sufficient for full biological activity and is essential for normal growth and viability. Cdc25p is able to form homodimers as well as heterodimers with Sdc25p, another S. cerevisiae Ras-GEF. Mutational analysis suggests that Cdc25p intra- and inter-molecular interactions may be involved in regulation of Cdc25p activity.Cdc25p is also regulated by glucose; the presence of glucose in the media results in Cdc25p phosphorylation, which causes decreased protein association with membranes and decreased interaction with the Ras-GTPases. Mutation of potentially phosphorylated residues in this region leads to changes in the cellular response to glucose. Additionally, when glucose is replaced by a nonfermentable carbon source such as ethanol, overall levels of Cdc25p decrease slightly. Unrelated to carbon source, protein levels also drop when cells are exposed to various stresses such as heat  and ethanol shocks and oxidative stress. Deletion of CDC25 is lethal in some S. cerevisiae strains, but null mutants can be rescued by overexpression of SDC25. In the W303 strain background, Cdc25p activity is not necessary for growth in glucose but essential for growth in galactose and non-fermentable carbon sources. While the noncatalytic N-terminal domain of Cdc25p shares no similarity with proteins from other organisms, the C-terminal domain is homologous to the catalytic domain of many Ras-GEFs.

Homologs include CDK1 in animals and cdc2 in S. pombe. Waves of CDK activity drive events of the cell cycle through phosphorylation of key substrates. To accomplish these waves of activity, Cdc28p associates with different regulators throughout the cell cycle. The expression of several of these regulators is periodic which serves to limit their window of action to the proper time in the cell cycle.The first wave of CDK activity occurs when Cdc28p associates with G1 cyclins and Cks1p. The G1 cyclins are Cln1p, Cln2p, and Cln3p. Cln3p/Cdc28p activity is required for setting the size threshold at which cells pass through START. Once committed Cln3p/Cdc28p inactivates a repressor of G1 transcription, Whi5p, which in turn leads to active SBFand MBF, transcription factors that promote transcription of CLN1, CLN2, and genes required for S-phase. Cln1p and Cln2p are important for initiating polarized growth at the site of bud emergence, promoting spindle pole bodyduplication and inhibiting Sic1p and Cdh1p, two CDK inhibitors. During G1, Sic1p binds and inhibits the growing pool of Cdc28p/B-type cyclin complexes. Towards the end of G1, Cdc28p/Cln1p and Cdc28p/Cln2p complexes phosphorylate Sic1p and target it for degradation.. The absence of Sic1p allows a wave of CDK/B-cyclin activity that drives DNA replication and entry into mitosis.B-type cyclins Clb1p, Clb2p, Clb3p, Clb4p, Clb5p, and Clb6p regulate Cdc28p during S, G2, and M phases. Cdc28p association with Clb5p and Clb6p drives DNA replication. Association with Clb3p, Clb4p, and Clb5p promotes maturation and separation of spindle pole bodies, and proper spindle segregationwhile Cdc28p association with Clb2ppromotes entry into mitosis and triggers a switch in bud growth from polarized to isotropic. The metaphase to anaphase transition occurs when securin, an inhibitor of DNA segregation is destroyed by the proteosome. Mitotic CDK activity is required to target Pds1p for degradation by directly phosphorylating Pds1p and activating the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome..Once DNA is segregated, exit from mitosisrequires that mitotic CDK activity be turned off. This is accomplished by degradation of mitotic cyclins and inhibition of remaining mitotic activity by Sic1p. In the absence of mitotic CDK activity, G1 cyclins can once again accumulate.In addition to being regulated by binding partners, Cdc28p is regulated by post-translational modifications. Cak1p phosphorylation of Cdc28p on threonine 169 is essential for CDK activity and is thought to precede cyclin binding. Phosphorylation of Cdc28p on tyrosine 19by Swe1p kinaseinhibits mitotic CDK activity and hence, entry into mitosis. This phosphorylation is removed by the phosphatase Mih1p. Phosphorylation of Y19 is critical for enforcing the morphogenesis checkpoint. When cells experience an environmental perturbation that disrupts bud formation, the morphogenesis checkpoint delays entry into mitosis until a bud is formed. The checkpoint impinges on Swe1p and Mih1p to inactivate the mitotic CDK, insuring that mitosis does not occur in an unbudded cell. Unlike in S. pombe and metazoans, Swe1p and/or Mih1p are not direct targets of the spindle checkpointsor DNA checkpoints.Developmental programs such as mating, meiosis and sporulation, and pseudohyphal growth require alterations in cell cycle control. For example, during mating, pheromone-dependent inhibition of Cln/Cdc28p complexes by Far1p arrests cells in G1 so cell-cell fusion can occur. When sporulation is induced, cells enter meiosis from G1, but CLN1 and CLN2 are repressed by a mechanism that makes meiosis and mitosis incompatible."},{"body" : "CDC3 is an essential gene that encodes a septin.

SCF-mediated ubiquitination involves three sequential enzymatic steps: ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin through the formation of a high-energy thioester linkage with a ubiquitin-activating enzyme; transfer of the activated ubiquitin to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; and the E2-catalyzed transfer of activated ubiquitin to a specific lysine residueof the target protein, aided by substrate-specific components of SCF ubiquitin protein ligase complexes. This sequence is repeated until multiple chains of ubiquitin are attached, thereby marking the protein for rapid degradation by the 26S proteasome.SCF ubiquitin protein ligases are RING-H2 type ligase family members that function as target recognition modules, bringing Cdc34p and substrates into close proximity, thereby positioning Cdc34p for efficient transfer of activated ubiquitin. SCF ubiquitin ligase core complexes are composed of several shared subunits including Skp1p, an adaptor protein that binds and recruits a variety of F-box containing proteins; Cdc53p, a cullin family member that recruits Cdc34p to Skp1p/F-box proteins; Hrt1p, a RING-H2 domain protein that stimulates ubiquitin-ligase activity; and Cdc34p, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of activated ubiquitin to the target protein. In addition to these shared subunits SCF complexes also contain one of several unique F-box motif containing proteinsthat function as substrate-specific adaptors or specificity determinants recruiting multiply phosphorylated substrates to the SCF core complex. Multiple SCF-F-box specific substrates have been identified.

The F-box proteins Cdc4p, Grr1p, and Met30p are also intrinsically unstable and are able to catalyze their own SCF-mediated ubiquitination and destruction via an autocatalytic mechanism proposed to facilitate rapid switching among multiple SCF complexes. As a component of the SCF core complex, Cdc34p has been directly implicated in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of all of the substrates listed above.cdc34 was originally identified as a cell division cyclemutant that arrests at the G1/S phase transition with multiple elongated buds and unreplicated DNA, similar to cdc4, cdc53 and hrt1 mutants. Deletion of the CDK inhibitor SIC1 alters the terminal phenotype of cdc34, cdc53 and cdc4 mutants, resulting in cells that now arrest at the G2/M phase transition of the cell cycle with replicated DNA and a single round bud. It is therefore the accumulation of this SCF substratethat is solely responsible for the failure of these mutants to enter into S phase, and emphasizes the importance of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis for regulated passage through key cell cycle transitions.Cdc34p is regulated by phosphorylation, autoubiquitination and self-association. The carboxy-terminal tail of Cdc34p is phosphorylated on serine residues by casein kinase 2, and phophorylation regulates the intrinsic catalytic activity of the enzyme and its activity when assayed in the presence of SCF-Cdc4p. The modulation of Cdc34p activity in turn affects the expression of methioninebiosynthetic genesas well as cell cycle progression, due to effects on Cdc34p substrates. Cdc34p is also able to catalyze its own ubiquitination via a mechanism that involves intramolecular transfer of the thiol-ester linked ubiquitin to a C-terminal lysine residue. Autoubiquitination of Cdc34p is stimulated by SCF, or by a Cdc53p-Hrt1p subcomplex, although the regulatory importance of this modification has yet to be determined.

Cdc37p was then shown to be the 50 kDa protein found in complexes with several Hsp90 kinase targets.

In addition, to these shared subunits, SCF complexes also contain one of several unique F-box motif containing proteins, including Cdc4p, Grr1p, Met30p, Dia2p, or Saf1p, that function as substrate specific adaptors or specificity determinants recruiting multiply phosphorylated substrates to the SCF core complex. Multiple substrates have been identified for specific SCF-F-box protein complexes. SCF-Cdc4p facilitates the polyubiquitination of Sic1p, Far1p, Cdc6p, Clb6pand Hac1p; substrates of SCF-Grr1p include Cln1p, Cln2p, Gic1p, and Gic2p; substrates of SCF-Met30p include Met4pand Swe1p; SCF-Dia2p polyubiquitinates Tec1p; and SCF-Saf1p polyubiquitinates Aah1p. The F-box proteins CDC4, GRR1 and MET30 are also intrinsically unstable and are able to catalyze their own SCF-mediated ubiquitination and destruction via an autocatalytic mechanism proposed to facilitate rapid switching among multiple SCF complexes. Finally, a subcomplex containing Cdc53p and Hrt1p functions as a ubiquitin-ligase module capable of activating the autoubiquitination of Cdc34p.cdc53 was originally identified as a cell division cyclemutant that arrests at the G1/S phase transition with multiple elongated buds and unreplicated DNA, similar to cdc4, cdc34 and hrt1 mutants. Cln2p and Sic1p are stabilized in both cdc53-1 and cdc34-2 mutants arrested at the restrictive temperature; overexpression of either CLN2 or CLN3 in cdc53-1 or cdc34-2 mutants exacerbates this phenotype, impairing colony formation at the permissive temperature. Deletion of the CDK inhibitor SIC1 alters the terminal phenotype of cdc53, cdc34 and cdc4 mutants, resulting in cells that now arrest at the G2/M phase transition of the cell cycle with replicated DNA and a single round bud.Cdc53p is regulated by neddylation, a ubiquitin-like modification in which the protein Rub1pis conjugated to its substrate. Neddylation of cullins has been proposed to positively regulate E3 ligase activity and assembly of SCF complexes.Cdc53p is evolutionarily conserved and multiple homologs exist in many species. Cullins were first identified in C. elegans, and CUL-1 mutants exhibit tissue hyperplasia resulting from a decreased ability to exit the cell cycle during development, and accelerated G1-to-S phase progression. Human CUL1, the closest human CDC53 cullin homolog, is a subunit of a functionally conserved SCF ubiquitin ligase complex that is involved in the degradation of key regulators of the mammalian cell cycle. Human CUL1 complements the growth defect of conditional CDC53 mutants and assembles into functional chimeric ubiquitin ligase complexes with yeast components."},{"body" : "Cdc6p is an unstable proteinthat is required for the assembly and maintenance of the pre-replicative complex. The pre-RC is an assembly of proteins that forms at origins of DNA replication between late M phase and the G1/S transition and includes proteins believed to act in DNA replication initiation. In pre-RC formation, Cdc6p acts as a loading factor for the Mcm2-7 proteins. Both CDC6 mRNA and protein levels peak at the M/G1 transition, when pre-RCs are formed; de novo Cdc6p synthesis is required for each round of DNA replication. Transcriptional repression of CDC6 prevents both pre-RC formation and initiation of DNA synthesis. cdc6 temperature-sensitive mutants are defective in replication initiation; established pre-RCs are thermolabile in a cdc6 temperature-sensitive mutant. Cdc6p must be present before late G1 to permit pre-RC formation. Cdc6p homologs are required for DNA replication early in S phase in S. pombeand Xenopus. Cdc6p and its homologs also show sequence similarity to subunits of eukaryotic and prokaryotic clamp-loaders such as RFC, which load ring-shaped DNA polymerase processivity factors onto DNA. All Cdc6p homologues contain a bipartite Walker ATP-binding motif and the phenotypes of mutations in the Walker A motif suggest that nucleotide binding is important for establishing the prereplicative complex at replication origins."},{"body" : "CDC60 was first identified as a temperature sensitive mutant that arrested at START upon shift to the restrictive temperature. It encodes the cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthase. The cell cycle arrest of the mutant is probably due to the block in protein synthesis that results from a lack of charged leucyl-tRNA. CDC60 is 50% identical to the Neurospora crassa cytosolic leucyl-tRNA synthase, and has regions of 19-21% identity to E. coli leucyl-, isoleucyl-, and methionyl-tRNA synthase. The yeast Cdc60p can aminoacylate E.coli tRNA-Leu.About aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases... In a process critical for accurate translation of the genetic code, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetasesattach amino acids specifically to cognate tRNAs, thereby charging the tRNAs. The catalysis is accomplished via a two-step mechanism. First, the synthetase activates the amino acid in an ATP-dependent reaction, producing aminoacyl-adenylate and releasing inorganic pyrophosphate. Second, the enzyme binds the correct tRNA and transfers the activated amino acid to either the 2 or 3 terminal hydroxyl group of the tRNA, forming the aminoacyl-tRNA and AMP.Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases possess precise substrate specificity and, despite their similarity in function, vary in size, primary sequence and subunit composition. Individual members of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family can be categorized in one of two classes, depending on amino acid specificity. Class I enzymestypically contain two highly conserved sequence motifs, are monomeric or dimeric, and aminoacylate at the 2 terminal hydroxyl of the appropriate tRNA. Class II enzymestypically contain three highly conserved sequence motifs, are dimeric or tetrameric, and aminoacylate at the 3 terminal hydroxyl of the appropriate tRNA."},{"body" : "Cdc7p is an essential serine/threonine protein kinase whose activity is required throughout S phase for replication origin firing. Mutations in CDC7 cause cell cycle arrest after START but before the hydroxyurea arrest point. Cdc7p is regulated by varying levels of Dbf4p, the same way that CDKs are regulated by cyclins. Cdc7p is the catalytic subunit, activated by association with Dbf4p during late G1. The Cdc7p-Dbf4p complex interacts physically with replication origins: Cdc7p interacts with Orc2p, a component of the origin recognition complex, and Dbf4p interacts with origin DNA. Several lines of evidence suggest that members of the Mcm2-7 protein family are the most likely candidates for in vivo Cdc7p-Dbf4p substrates. Mcm2p and other Mcm2-7 proteins are in vitro substrates for Cdc7p-Dbf4p kinase activity, and the phosphorylation of Mcm2p in vivo depends upon Cdc7p-Dbf4p. Further, a mutation in MCM5/CDC46 can bypass the requirement for Cdc7p kinase activity in initiating DNA synthesis. Results of two-hybrid and GST-Mcm2p fusion affinity column chromatography showed that Cdc7p and Dbf4p interact physically with Mcm2p. Homologs of Cdc7p have been identified in S. pombe, Xenopus, mouse, and human, and a Dbf4p homolog exists in S. pombe; evidence suggests that the homologs may perform the same function as the S. cerevisiae proteins. The Xenopus Cdc7p homolog is required for DNA replication in vivo and in vitro, and mutations in the S. pombe homologcan block the initiation of DNA replication. The human and S. pombe Cdc7p homologs can phosphorylate Mcm2-7 proteins in vitro."},{"body" : "CDC9 encodes DNA ligase, an essential enzyme that joins Okazaki fragments during DNA replication.

A second DNA ligase, Dnl4p, has been identified in yeast; it is most similar to mammalian DNA ligase IV. Dnl4p cannot substitute for Cdc9p in excision repair. The E. coli DNA ligase can complement a cdc9 deletion. Like many other genes encoding DNA replication proteins, CDC9 is transcribed during late G1 and S phases of the cell cycle.

Null mutants are viable and display weak 5-fluorocytidine resistance, which indicates a partial impairment in cytidine metabolism. The active enzyme is a homotetramer. Thus the enzyme complex contains four active sites, each of which is complexed with Zn2+. It is found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.Cdd1p has been shown to deaminate cytidine to uridine in an ectopically expressed fragment of human apolipoprotein BmRNA, which suggests that mRNA C>U editing may exist in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, native substrates for Cdd1p-dependent RNA editing have not been identified, thus it is not clear if this activity is biologically relevant. Cdd1p has also been shown to deaminate deoxycytidine in vitro, but the biological significance of this has also not been established.The Cdd1 protein has similarity to a number of proteins from other species, from bacteria to mammals. Cdd1p is similar to mouse activation-induced cytidine deaminase, human activation-induced deaminase proteinand to human RNA-editing enzyme apolipoprotein B editing catalytic subunit 1 protein. Mutations in the AICDA protein have been detected in humans with hyper-IgM type 2 syndrome. Cdd1p contains a tertiary fold with high structural homology to the catalytic domains of Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase and Bacillus subtilis cytidine deaminase.

These include mitotic cyclins, the sister chromatid separation inhibitor Pds1p, the Kip1p and Cin8p motor proteins, Cdc5p, and the spindle disassemblyfactor, Ase1p.Deletion of Cdh1 results in slow growth and the accumulation of very large amounts of Clb2p and Ase1p. Further analysis of the mutants demonstrated that Cdh1p regulates the activity and substrate specificity of the APC. It serves as an activator of the APC and mediates  ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation of the mitotic cyclin Clb2p, the polo kinase Cdc5p, and the spindle protein Ase1p during anaphase of the cell cycle.The level of Cdh1p remains constant throughout the cell cycle, however it only binds the APC during G1. For the rest of the cell cycle, the association of Cdh1p with the APC is inhibited due to its phosphorylation by the kinase Cdc28p.CDH1 is a homolog of CDC20, another APC activator.

It was originally isolated as a complex containing Prp19p and at least eight other proteins that complemented the splicing defect of extracts from prp19 mutant cells. Subsequent work has identified the genes encoding the additional members of the complex: NTC20, SNT309, ISY1, SYF2, CWC2, PRP46, CLF1, CEF1, and SYF1. The complex appears to be conserved as mammalian cells contain a functional equivalent called the Prp19/CDC5 complex composed of a similar, though not identical, set of proteins. The nineteen complex associates with the assembling splicesosome during or after the dissociation of the U4 snRNA, stabilizes the U5 and U6 snRNAs in the activated spliceosomal complex that is catalytic for the first step of splicing, and remains through the second step of splicing. Following disassembly of the spliceosome, members of the nineteen complex have been found in association with the excised intron.The nineteen complex also appears to be involved in control of fidelity and efficiency of splicing. Mutations in isy1 suppress the relaxed fidelity of recognition of the conserved branchpoint sequence conferred by mutations in prp16, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase required for the second step of splicing, and an isy1 null mutation decreases accuracy of 3-splice site usage. In addition, cells with mutations in prp45, a protein found in association with NineTeen complex members, are defective in splicing of introns with non-canonical sequences at the branchpoint or the 5 or 3 splice sites. Splicing efficiency of various transcripts is differentially affected by mutations in spliceosomal components, such as PRP19, suggesting that the spliceosome can distinguish between individual transcripts and possibly use these differences to specifically regulate gene expression via control of splicing. Interestingly, the Drosophila crooked neck proteinregulates glial cell differentiation by facilitating the splicing of specific target genes.Mutational and genetic analysis of several nineteen complex subunits has suggested involvement in other cellular processes in addition to splicing, such as cell cycle regulation, cytoskeletal structure, DNA repair, and vesicular transport. In most cases it appears that the primary defect is in splicing and the other defects are the result of failure to remove an intron from the transcript of a gene involved in that process. However Clf1p, and possibly also Prp19p, may have other direct roles in addition to splicing. About CEF1  CEF1 was identified as a homolog of the S. pombe cdc5 gene encoding a Myb-related protein, which is highly conserved and found in multiple species including H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, A. thaliana, and S. pombe. While initial evidence suggested that the conserved cdc5gene encodes a transcription factor required for expression of genes needed for the G2/M transition, it has been shown that that Cef1p does not act as a transcription factor for a number of genes transcribed at G2/M, and that a cef1 null in S. cerevisiae is defective in the first step of splicing. Moreover, the human CDC5 protein purifies in spliceosomal complexes. Thus, it is now clear that the role of this conserved protein is in RNA splicing via the spliceosome as a member of the NineTeen Complex."},{"body" : "Microtubules are conserved cytoskeletal elements that form by the polymerization of alpha- and beta-tubulin heterodimers.

One such gene, CDC28, was shown to be a highly conserved cyclin-dependent kinasethat plays a critical role in progression through the cell cycle. The CDKs are only catalytically active when associated with a cyclin. In addition to the cyclins, several other positive and negative regulators of CDKs have been identified. One such regulator is Cks1p, a small protein that physically associates with the activeform of Cdc28p and acts as its phosphoadaptor subunit. CKS1 was originally isolated as a high-copy suppressor of cdc28 mutations. Null mutations in CKS1 are lethal, and temperature-sensitive cks1 alleles cause pleiotropic cell cycle defects but have no effects on Cdc28/cyclin complex formation or activity. Thus, it was proposed that Cks1p may perform a more subtle role in regulation of Cdc28p, such as targeting the Cdc28/cyclin complex to its substrates. The crystal structure of a human CDK bound to human Cks1 showed that CDK-Cks1 binding occurs at a site adjacent to the catalytic site, which supports this model. It was shown that Cks1p binds Sic1p and mediates its cyclin-dependent docking to CDK, thus facilitating the multisite phosphorylation of Sic1p that directs it to SCF-mediated destruction at the onset of S phase.

CLF1 is essential and cells depleted of Clf1p arrest in G2/M and are defective in spliceosome assembly, specifically in the step of adding the tri-snRNP to the spliceosomal complex. In addition to interacting directly with a number of nineteen complex members, Clf1p interacts with the U1 proteins Prp40p and Mud2p.Clf1p-depleted cells arrest as large-budded cells, but with intact, fully formed spindles suggesting that failure to splice the TUB1 and TUB3 genes encoding tubulin is not the primary defect, unlike what is seen in other nineteen complex mutations that produce cell cycle arrest. This is further confirmed by genetic analysis with a mad2 spindle checkpoint mutant indicating that the arrest does not depend on an intact spindle checkpoint. CLF1 appears to have a direct role in initiation of DNA replication as clf1-1 mutants fail to initiate DNA replication, Clf1p interacts directly with the Orc2p component of the Origin Recognition Complex, and Clf1p localizes to chromatin and replication origins in an ORC-dependent manner. Clf1p also interacts with Csm1p, a protein involved in meiotic chromosome segregation and spore formation."},{"body" : "CLN1 encodes a G1 cyclin involved in regulation of the cell cycle.

This wide range of roles is possible because calmodulin undergoes a conformational change upon calcium binding. The apo-calcium form has a very different structure than the calcium bound form and thus binds to a different set of protein targets. Although calmodulin is essential, the essential functions mediated by calmodulin do not require calcium-binding, as cells with mutant forms of calmodulin which lack the ability to bind Ca2+ are viable and have only minor defects in growth and morphology in standard laboratory conditions. Some of the Ca2+-dependent targets of calmodulin only become essential in response to various stress conditions. Thus calmodulin has many targets, both Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent.Ca2+-independent roles of Calmodulin Ca2+-independent targets of calmodulin, some of which are essential genes, play roles in the organization and formation of the spindle pole body, karyogamy, actin cytoskeletal organization and bud emergence, endocytosis, and microautophagy. Calmodulin localizes to the central plaque of the spindle pole body through its interaction with Spc110p. Binding by calmodulin is required for correct localization of the essential Spc110p component to the SPB and thus the formation of the SPBand also for karyogamy. Calmodulin also interacts with Myo2p, one of two type V myosin heavy chains. Through its interaction with Myo2p, calmodulin is required for polarized growth of yeast cells and inheritance of the vacuole by daughter cells. Calmodulin may also interact with the other type V heavy chain encoded by Myo4p. Through interactions with both the unconventional type I myosin, encoded by MYO5, and Arc35p, a component of the Arp2/3 complex, calmodulin is also required for receptor-mediated endocytosis. Calmodulin is also involved in microautophagy, a role which may be mediated by Vtc2p and Vtc3p.Ca2+-dedependent roles of Calmodulin Calmodulin also has multiple Ca2+-dependent targets, including calcineurin and calmodulin-stimulated protein kinases. Calcineurin, or PP2B, is a Ca2+ and calmodulin dependent phosphatase that is highly conserved amongst eukaryotic organisms and regulates many different processes. Calcineurin is composed of a heterodimer of a catalytic A subunit, encoded by CMP2 and CNA1, and a regulatory B subunit, encoded by CNB1, which is an EF-hand domain protein related to calmodulin. When stimulatory levels of Ca2+ are present, calcium-bound calmodulin binds to the A subunit, displacing an autoinhibitory domain of the A subunit. In yeast, calcineurin regulates at least three different processes: a stress-activated transcriptional pathway, calcium homeostasis, and the G2 to M transition of the cell cycle. Calmodulin also regulates calcium and calmodulin dependent kinases, of which there are two in S. cerevisiae, encoded by CMK1 and CMK2. In the presense of calcium and calmodulin, they become autophosphorylated and can phosphorylate many different substrates. The calmodulin-dependent kinases regulate a number of different stress responses, including response to mating pheromone, response to organic acids, and tolerance to heat stress.Other roles of Calmodulin Calmodulin plays additional roles in the cell, and it is not yet clear whether these processes are dependent on or independent of calcium. Calmodulin plays a role in vacuole fusion. Some calmodulin mutants display abnormal vacuolar morphologies, calmodulin binds to vacuoles in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and in vitro assays indicate that calmodulin is required for a post-docking step in vacuole fusion. However, it is not clear whether this process requires calcium as a non-calcium binding mutant shows normal vacuolar morphology in vivoand variable results have been obtained in assays testing whether the non-calcium binding mutant protein supports vacuolar fusion in vitro. The effect of calmodulin on vacuolar fusion may be due to its affects on remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton. Overexpression of Mss4p, a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, suppresses the actin cytoskeleton defects of a particular calmodulin mutation, which also causes reduced levels of phosphatidylinositol-bisphosphate.Structure of calmodulin and comparison with those from other organims Calmodulin is a highly conserved protein found in all eukaryotes, including animals, plants, and fungi. While the amino acid sequences of calmodulins from multicellular organisms are more than 90% identical, that from S. cerevisiae is significantly diverged, with only 60% identity to vertebrate calmodulins. Calmodulin contains four EF-hand domains; in most species, including S. pombe, each motif chelates one Ca2+ ion. However, in calmodulin from S. cerevisiae, the fourth motif is divergent and does not bind calcium, making it the only yet characterized calmodulin to bind less than four Ca2+ ions. Despite these structural differences between calmodulin of S. cerevisiae and other organisms, its basic functions appear to be conserved."},{"body" : "About the early stages of rRNA processing and 40S small ribosomal subunit assembly The early stages of ribosome assembly occur in conjunction with processing of the 35S pre-ribosomal RNA transcript into the mature 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNA molecules. The first three cleavages at A0, A1, and A2are essential for production of the 18S rRNA and the 40S small ribosomal subunit, but mutations which interfere with these cleavages have little effect on production of the 60S large ribosomal subunit. These three early cleavages occur in a series of large U3-associated ribonucleoprotein complexesand require base pairing of the U3 snoRNA with sequences in the 5-ETS and the 18S rRNA. Click on the following figure for more details about the rDNA repeat and cleavage sites within the rRNA transcript:About the 90S preribosome and SSU processome complexes A number of U3-containing early ribosome assembly and rRNA processing complexes have been identified that contain the 35S pre-rRNA transcript and have overlapping but not identical protein compositions. Both the 90S preribosome and the small subunitprocessome complexes contain ribosomal proteins, primarily of the small subunit, and non-ribosomal proteins presumably involved in rRNA processing and assembly of the small 40S ribsomal subunit. While many proteins are found in both complexes, some are found in only one or the other. It may be that the 90S preribosome and SSU processome complexes are both intermediates in a series of complexes leading to the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit, or it may be that the SSU processome lies on an alternate assembly pathway. The 90S preribosome complex is described as corresponding to the earliest detectable rRNA processing and ribosome assembly complex. The 90S is itself assembled from a number of stable subcomplexes including the t-UTP subcomplex, the Pwp2p/UTP-B subcomplexwhich interacts directly with the 5-ETS of the 35S pre-rRNA, the UTP-C subcomplex, and the Mpp10 subcomplex. The t-UTP subcomplex is also found as part of the SSU processome complex, which is slightly smaller at 80S. Depletion of any of the members of the t-UTP subcomplex results in decreased transcription of rDNA leading to decreased levels of the primary 35S rRNA transcript. In contrast, mutation or depletion of most other members of either the 90S preribosome or SSU processome complexes causes decreased 18S rRNA levels without affecting the levels of the 25S or 5.8S rRNAs.Non-ribosomal protein components of the 90S preribosome and SSU processome Subunits of both the 90S preribosomeand SSU processomeinclude: Bud21p, Dip2p, Ecm16p, Emg1p, Imp3p, Imp4p, Krr1p, Mpp10p, Nan1p, Noc4p, Nop1p, Nop14p, Nop58p, Pwp2p, Rrp5p, Rrp9p, Nop56p, Sof1p, Utp4p, Utp6p, Utp7p, Utp8p, Utp9p, Utp10p, Utp13p, Utp15p, Utp18p, Utp20p, Utp21p, and Utp22p  Additional subunits of the 90S preribosomeinclude: Bfr2p, Bms1p, Cbf5p, Cms1p, Dbp8p, Dim1p, Enp1p, Enp2p, Has1p, Kre33p, Mrd1p, Nop9p, Pno1p, Prp43p, Rcl1p, Rok1p, Rrp12p, Scl1p, Slx9p, Tsr1p, and Utp30p  Additional subunits of the SSU processomeinclude: Fcf1p, Utp23p, Sas10p, Snu13p, Utp5p, Utp11p, and Utp14p"},{"body" : "The cytochrome bc1 complexis a highly conserved enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

The crystal structure of the complex shows that two functional units, each containing these ten subunits, associate with each other in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Assembly of a functional complex requires two proteins, Cbp3p and Cbp4p, that are not components of the complex but may associate with it during assembly. It also requires Bcs1p, an AAA-family ATPase that interacts with a precursor of the complex to mediate incorporation of the Rip1p and Qcr10p subunits. The mechanism of energy transfer by the complex, known as the protonmotive Q cycle, has been studied in detail. The net result of the Q cycle is the stepwise transfer of an electron through the complex from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, coupled with the translocation of a proton across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The function of the cytochrome bc1 complex is essential to the energy-generating process of oxidative phosphorylation, which is carried out by the enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Cytochrome b, which contains two b-type heme groups, is one of the catalytic subunits of the cytochrome bc1 complex and comprises a major part of the site at which ubiquinol is oxidized, termed center P of the enzyme.Cytochrome b, encoded by the mitochondrial COB gene, is the only mitochondrially-encoded subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex. The structure and expression of the COB gene are extremely complex: it contains multiple introns, whose number varies between strains, and its mRNA maturation and translation require multiple nuclear-encoded proteins. Generation of the correct 5 end of the COB mRNA, which is cotranscribed with an upstream tRNA gene, requires the action of Cbp1p and Cbt1p. The COB gene of the genome reference strain S288C has five introns, named bI1 through bI5. The first intron, bI1, is a group II, self-splicing intron; the other introns are group I. The second through fourth intronscontain open reading frames that are contiguous with the upstream COB exons, such that translation of alternately spliced mRNAs produces fusion proteins comprised of both cytochrome b sequences and intron-encoded sequences. These proteins have maturase activity and are involved in splicing of introns from both the COB and COX1 genes. Splicing of the fifth intron, bI5, requires the nuclear-encoded protein Cbp2p. Translation of mRNAs bearing the COB 5-untranslated leader requires the specific translational activators Cbs1p and Cbs2p.Cytochrome b is highly conserved across bacteria and all eukaryotes.

It is well-conserved, with homologs in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.Cox11p is anchored to the mitochondrial inner membrane by a single transmembrane segment. Its C terminus, which includes a copper-binding domain, is exposed to the intermembrane space and forms a homodimer that binds two Cuions. Copper is delivered to Cox11p by Cox17p, which acts as a copper chaperone specific for Cox11p and Sco1p.Cox11p also interacts with mitochondrial ribosomes via its N terminus, although the importance of this is not clear because the N terminus is apparently not essential for function. However, the link between Cox11p function and the mitochondrial translation system appears to be conserved, since both of the two COX11 orthologs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe contain 5 extensions relative to S. cerevisiae COX11 that encode proteins similar to the mitochondrial ribosomal protein Rsm22p. Cox11p may assist in copper incorporation into Cox1p in a co-translational manner. In keeping with this hypothesis, levels of Cox1p are reduced in a cox11 null mutant.The cox11 null mutant exhibits a respiratory defect, failing to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources due to its inability to assemble cytochrome c oxidase. cox11 mutants also display sensitivity to various chemicals including photoactivated psoralens, N-nitrosodiethylamine, 1,2:7,8-diepoxyoctane, and hydrogen peroxide. The Cox11p function in hydrogen peroxide resistance is separable from its function in cytochrome c oxidase assembly, since the null mutant is both respiratory deficient and hydrogen peroxide sensitive, while cox11 point mutations that affect its copper-binding sites block respiratory growth without causing hydrogen peroxide sensitivity. The hydrogen peroxide sensitive phenotype of the null mutant is likely due to accumulation of a transient heme A3-Cox1p intermediate that confers oxidant sensitivity.

In the yeast plasma membrane sphingolipids concentrate with ergosterol to form lipid rafts, specialized membrane microdomains implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including sorting of membrane proteins and lipids, as well as organizing and regulating signaling cascades. Intermediates in sphingolipid biosynthesis have been shown to play important roles as signaling molecules and growth regulators. Sphingolipid long chain bases, dihydrosphingosineand phytosphingosine, have been implicated as secondary messengers in signaling pathways that regulate the heat stress response. Other intermediates, phytoceramide and long-chain base phosphates, have been shown to be components of the tightly-controlled ceramide/LCBP rheostat, which regulates cell growth.

The cytoplasmic exosome is associated with Ski7p and the SKI complex and is involved in RNA catabolic processes that include both the routine turnover of normal mRNAas well as the degradation of aberrant mRNAs. The 10-subunit core exosome complexis the same in both locations, but the nuclear exosome contains an additional subunitand two additional accessory factors. Although the exosome was originally described as a complex of exonucleases, with multiple subunits proposed to have RNase activity, later work has shown that this mechanism is unlikely in yeast. With the exception of Ski6p, none of the yeast subunits that show homology to E. coli RNase PH retain the active site residues seen in the bacterial or archael enzymes. Further research has also demonstrated that most, if not all, detectable enzymatic activity resides in the Dis3p and Rrp6p subunits.CSL4 encodes a core subunit of the exosome and is predicted to contain an S1 RNA binding domain.

In peroxisomes, the primary source of hydrogen peroxide is that produced during fatty acid beta-oxidation. In mitochondria, hydrogen peroxide is produced by the superoxide dismutases Sod1p and Sod2p in defending against reactive oxygen species. Catalases break down hydrogen peroxide into dioxygenand water molecules. Cta1p activity is important during oxidative stress response and in protecting proteins against oxidative inactivation. Cta1p activity is also increased during caloric restriction and during oxidative stress caused by the processes of aging, acid stress adaptation, and thermotolerance.

It was originally isolated as a complex containing Prp19p and at least eight other proteins that complemented the splicing defect of extracts from prp19 mutant cells. Subsequent work has identified the genes encoding the additional members of the complex: NTC20, SNT309, ISY1, SYF2, CWC2, PRP46, CLF1, CEF1, and SYF1. The complex appears to be conserved as mammalian cells contain a functional equivalent called the Prp19/CDC5 complex composed of a similar, though not identical, set of proteins. The nineteen complex associates with the assembling splicesosome during or after the dissociation of the U4 snRNA, stabilizes the U5 and U6 snRNAs in the activated spliceosomal complex that is catalytic for the first step of splicing, and remains through the second step of splicing. Following disassembly of the spliceosome, members of the nineteen complex have been found in association with the excised intron.The nineteen complex also appears to be involved in control of fidelity and efficiency of splicing. Mutations in isy1 suppress the relaxed fidelity of recognition of the conserved branchpoint sequence conferred by mutations in prp16, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase required for the second step of splicing, and an isy1 null mutation decreases accuracy of 3-splice site usage. In addition, cells with mutations in prp45, a protein found in association with NineTeen complex members, are defective in splicing of introns with non-canonical sequences at the branchpoint or the 5 or 3 splice sites. Splicing efficiency of various transcripts is differentially affected by mutations in spliceosomal components, such as PRP19, suggesting that the spliceosome can distinguish between individual transcripts and possibly use these differences to specifically regulate gene expression via control of splicing. Interestingly, the Drosophila crooked neck proteinregulates glial cell differentiation by facilitating the splicing of specific target genes.Mutational and genetic analysis of several nineteen complex subunits has suggested involvement in other cellular processes in addition to splicing, such as cell cycle regulation, cytoskeletal structure, DNA repair, and vesicular transport. In most cases it appears that the primary defect is in splicing and the other defects are the result of failure to remove an intron from the transcript of a gene involved in that process.

Hsp70 family members often have multiple Hsp40 partners, and these specific pairings govern Hsp70 chaperone involvement in particular processes. All Hsp40s contain a highly conserved 75-amino acid J domain, which interacts with the ATPase domain of Hsp70 to stimulate ATP hydrolysis.

Iso-1-cytochrome c facilitates the penultimate and last steps of the mitochondrial respiratory chain via its covalently attached heme group: electron transfer from respiratory complex III to respiratory complex IV, and the final transfer of electrons to oxygen catalyzed by complex IV, cytochrome c oxidase. Cyc1p functions at the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane and comprises 95% of the total cytochrome c in aerobically grown cells. cyc1 null mutants are viable but exhibit decreased growth on non-fermentable carbon sources such as lactate. In vertebrates, it has been shown that mitochondrial release of cytochrome c initiates apoptosis by triggering caspase activation. CYC1 transcription is induced by oxygen, heme and lactate, and repressed by glucose. Induction by oxygen occurs through binding of the transcription factor Hap1p to one of two upstream activation sequencesin the CYC1 promoter. A second upstream activation sequence, UAS2, mediates CYC1 repression by glucose via binding by Mig1p and the CCAAT-binding activator complex subunits Hap2p and Hap3p. In addition, chromatin structure has been postulated to contribute to transcriptional regulation. Newly-translated Cyc1p without an attached heme moiety, known as apocytochrome c, is prone to degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway. However, apocytochrome c can be protected from degradation, and its transport into the mitochondria enhanced, through tri-methylation of lysine-77 by the specific methyltransferase Ctm1p. Apocytochrome c is imported into mitochondria by insertion into the outer face of the outer membrane followed by interaction with the translocase of outer membranecomplex. Once in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, apocytochrome c binds to the cytochrome c heme lyase Cyc3p, which covalently attaches a heme group to Cyc1p. Heme attachment also results in Cyc1p conformational change, trapping the mature protein, holocytochrome c, in the intermembrane space. Due to the ease of Cyc1p mutant identification and protein purification as well as early knowledge of the peptide sequence, the cytochrome c system has been used to study many general biological processes including mRNA 3-end formation, post-translational modification, chromosomal translocation, and evolutionary divergence of duplicated regions."},{"body" : "CYC7 encodes an isoform, known as iso-2, of the electron carrier protein cytochrome c. Cytochrome c facilitates the penultimate and last steps of the mitochondrial respiratory chain via its covalently attached heme group: electron transfer from respiratory complex III to respiratory complex IV, and the final transfer of electrons to oxygen catalyzed by complex IV, cytochrome c oxidase. The cytochrome c genes were among the first yeast genes to be identified and have been studied extensively.Transcription of CYC7 is repressed under aerobic conditions and induced at low oxygen concentrations. Repression under aerobic conditions is mediated by the transcriptional repressor Rox1p; CYC7 is additionally subject to carbon catabolite repression. The CYC7 promoter contains a binding site for direct transcriptional activation by Hap1p in the presence of heme.Cyc7p comprises about 5% of the cytochrome c present in cells grown under aerobic, non-glucose repressing conditions, while the major isoform, Cyc1p, comprises 95%; the two isoforms are 84% identical to each other at the protein sequence level. Unlike iso-1 cytochrome c, the Cyc7p apopoteinis not subject to degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway. Similar to Cyc1p, however, a single lysine residue of apo-Cyc7p is trimethylated in the cytoplasm by the action of the cytochrome c-specific methyltransferase Ctm1p. Cyc7p is imported into the mitochondrial intermembrane space by a mechanism requiring the outer membrane translocasecomplex. Once in the intermembrane space, Cyc7p is covalently attached to heme in a reaction catalyzed by cytochrome c heme lyase."},{"body" : "The Tup1p-Cyc8p corepressor is important for the repression of many genes involved in a wide variety of physiological processes. Tup1p-Cyc8p may also be involved in the derepression of at least some target genes. The active form of the corepressor consists of a protein complex containing four Tup1p subunits and a single Cyc8p subunit. The Tup1 protein comprises three functionally defined domains: an N-terminus involved in the interaction with Cyc8p; a central domain required for the repression activity of the complex; and a C-terminus containing seven WD40 repeats that form a beta-transducin-like propeller structure important for protein interactions and tetramerization.  Tup1p-Cyc8p mediates repression of target genes by different molecular mechanisms. Tup1p-Cyc8p can recruit histone deacetylases to genes, which results in deacetylation of histones producing a repressive chromatin structure. Tup1p-Cyc8p can also interact with hypoacetylated N-terminal tails of histones H3and H4that have been programmed for repression by the action of histone deacetylases. In addition, Tup1p-Cyc8p can interfere directly with the transcriptional machinery by interacting with factors important for the repressive activity of the RNA polymerase II mediator subcomplex.  Tup1p-Cyc8p is recruited to target genes by interaction with DNA-bound transcriptional repressors that recognize specific sequences within the target gene promoters. Such repressors include MatAlpha2p, which regulates mating-type-specific genes, Mig1p, which regulates glucose-repressed genes, Rfx1p, which is involved in DNA repair, and Sko1p, which is involved in stress responses. This gene-specific role has been complemented by observations that Tup1p might be involved in establishing domains of heterochromatin structure in the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes. These HAST domains contain clusters of Tup1p- and Cyc8p-repressed genes and coincide with regions that are deacetylated by the histone deacetylase Hda1p. Therefore, Tup1p-Cyc8p may establish the formation of heterochromatin in these regions by recruiting Hda1p. HAST domains are distinct from adjacent heterochromatin regions that are established via Tup1p-independent recruitment of the Sir2p histone deacetylase."},{"body" : "In S. cerevisiae, growth and metabolism in response to nutrients, particularly glucose, is regulated to a large degree by the Ras/cyclic AMPpathway. CYR1 encodes adenylate cyclase, the enzyme that synthesizes cAMP from ATP. Through its role in increasing cAMP levels to activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Cyr1p is involved in nutrient signaling, cell cycle progression, sporulation, cell growth, stress response, and longevity. In response to nutrients, Cyr1p is activated through the concerted actions of the cyclase associated protein Srv2p, the RasGEF Cdc25p, and either of the RAS GTPases Ras1p or Ras2p. Cyr1p activation is dependent upon its localization to the plasma membrane, a peripheral association that requires the RasGAP Ira1p. Cyr1p contains five domains: an N-terminal region of as yet unknown function, a Ras-binding region, a linker domain, a catalytic domain, and a C-terminal Srv2p-binding domain. Loss of Cyr1p activity leads to a decrease in the intracellular levels of cAMP, resulting in pleiotropic phenotypes that mimic nutrient starvation, such as growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, increased life-span, and defects in sporulation, conjugation, and utilization of nonfermentable carbon sources. cyr1 mutants are also more freeze tolerant and more resistant to certain types of stresses such as heat shock and oxidative stress. Adenylate cyclases can be found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. Although the adenylate cyclases from E. coli and S. cerevisiae are able to functionally complement each other, the lack of amino acid similarity between these enzymes leads to the speculation that cAMP synthesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is an example of evolutionary convergence."},{"body" : "The cytochrome bc1 complexis a highly conserved enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. In S. cerevisiae it consists of three catalytic subunits, Cobp, Rip1p, and Cyt1p, plus seven additional subunits: Cor1p, Qcr2p, Qcr6p, Qcr7p, Qcr8p, Qcr9p, and Qcr10p. The crystal structure of the complex shows that two functional units, each containing these ten subunits, associate with each other in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Assembly of a functional complex requires two proteins, Cbp3p and Cbp4p, that are not components of the complex but may associate with it during assembly. It also requires Bcs1p, an AAA-family ATPase that interacts with a precursor of the complex to mediate incorporation of the Rip1p and Qcr10p subunits. The mechanism of energy transfer by the complex, known as the protonmotive Q cycle, has been studied in detail. The net result of the Q cycle is the stepwise transfer of an electron through the complex from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, coupled with the translocation of a proton across the mitochondrial inner membrane. The function of the cytochrome bc1 complex is essential to the energy-generating process of oxidative phosphorylation, which is carried out by the enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.Cyt1p, more commonly known as cytochrome c1, is one of the catalytic subunits of the cytochrome bc1 complex and is essential for electron transfer within the complex and for respiratory growth. Maturation and mitochondrial import of Cyt1p involve proteolytic cleavages of the N- and C-terminal regions as well as insertion of a heme prosthetic group, which is mediated by cyctochrome c1 heme lyase. CYT1 is conserved across both prokaryotes and eukaryotes; its human homolog is CYC1."},{"body" : "About allantoin degradation  The allantoin degradation pathway, which converts allantoin to ammonia and carbon dioxide, allows S. cerevisiae to use allantoin as a sole nitrogen source.

Urea is then degraded to ammonia in a two-step process by the DUR1,2 protein, a multifunctional single enzyme originally thought to be encoded by two tightly-linked genes.

Dal80p, via a zinc finger binding domain, binds as a dimer to the URS-GATA found in the promoters of many genes involved in nitrogen utilization. The URS-GATA consists of a pair of 5-GATAA-3 sequences separated by at least 15bp with a preferential tail to tail orientation. Dal80p is able to from heterodimeric complexes with Gzf3p, which may influence the DNA affinity of these proteins. Dal80p targets include genes involved in the import and catabolism of glutamine, glutamate, proline, urea, arginine, GABA, and allantoin, as well as genes involved in vacuolar protein degradation. Dal80p is one of four GATA family members which are involved in mediating nitrogen-responsive gene expression; Gln3p and Gat1p acting as activators in opposition to the Dal80p and Gzf3p repressors. Gat1p and Dal80p/Gzf3p are able to directly compete for GATA binding sites. Additionally, these gene products transcriptionally regulate each other and themselves in an interdependent fashion. The promoters of the GAT1, DAL80, and GZF3 genes all contain multiple GATA sequences: DAL80 expression is regulated by Gln3p, Gat1p,and Dal80p; GAT1 expression is Gln3p and Dal80p regulated; GZF3 expression is moderately dependent on Gat1p and highly regulated by Dal80p. The expression levels themselves of GAT1 and DAL80 seem to regulate each other and are inversely correlated. Dal80p is similar to transcriptional regulators found in other fungi, birds, and mammals. In other organisms, regulation of nitrogen metabolism may play a role in their pathogenicity."},{"body" : "DBF20 is a putative serine/threonine-specific protein kinase with a role in cell cycle progression. It has 80% identity to DBF2, and was first isolated via low-stringency hybridization of a DBF2 probe to a yeast genomic DNA library. Deletion of DBF20 has no growth phenotype by itself, but is lethal in a strain that lacks DBF2. DBF2p and DBF20p carry out at least one essential late-mitotic function. Although a deletion of DBF2 is viable, several alleles of DBF2 are not; the lethality of these alleles can be overcome by overexpression of Spo12p, a factor that interacts with both Dbf2p and Dbf20p. Spo12p may therefore be the limiting cofactor that regulates the activities of these two kinases. Dbf20p may also have a role in the regulation of transcription, due to its similarity to Dbf2p which associates with Mob1p and the Ccr4p regulatory complex."},{"body" : "DBF4 is an essential gene that is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner. It encodes the regulatory subunit for the protein kinase Cdc7p; the activity of the Cdc7p-Dbf4p complex is required throughout S phase for the initiation of DNA synthesis at replication origins. The function of the Cdc7p-Dbf4p complex is analogous to that of cyclin-CDK complexes; here, Cdc7p is the catalytic subunit and is activated by association with Dbf4p during late G1. The Cdc7p-Dbf4p complex interacts physically with replication origins: Cdc7p interacts with Orc2p, and Dbf4p interacts with origin DNA. Dbf4p interacts with replication origins and with Cdc7p through different domains; both domains are essential for its function. Several lines of evidence suggest that members of the Mcm2-7 protein family are the most likely candidates for in vivo Cdc7p-Dbf4p substrates. Mcm2p and other Mcm2-7 proteins are in vitro substrates for Cdc7p-Dbf4p kinase activity, and the phosphorylation of Mcm2p in vivo depends upon Cdc7p-Dbf4p. Further, a mutation in MCM5/CDC46 can bypass the requirement for Cdc7p kinase activity in initiating DNA synthesis. Results of two-hybrid and GST-Mcm2 fusion affinity column chromatography showed that Cdc7p and Dbf4p interact physically with Mcm2p 6. A homolog of Dbf4p has been identified in S. pombe, and homologs of Cdc7p have been found in S. pombe, Xenopus, and human; evidence suggests that the homologs may perform the same function as the S. cerevisiae proteins."},{"body" : "About the early stages of rRNA processing and 40S small ribosomal subunit assembly The early stages of ribosome assembly occur in conjunction with processing of the 35S pre-ribosomal RNA transcript into the mature 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNA molecules. The first three cleavages at A0, A1, and A2are essential for production of the 18S rRNA and the 40S small ribosomal subunit, but mutations which interfere with these cleavages have little effect on production of the 60S large ribosomal subunit. These three early cleavages occur in a series of large U3-associated ribonucleoprotein complexesand require base pairing of the U3 snoRNA with sequences in the 5-ETS and the 18S rRNA. Click on the following figure for more details about the rDNA repeat and cleavage sites within the rRNA transcript:About the 90S preribosome and SSU processome complexes A number of U3-containing early ribosome assembly and rRNA processing complexes have been identified that contain the 35S pre-rRNA transcript and have overlapping but not identical protein compositions. Both the 90S preribosome and the small subunitprocessome complexes contain ribosomal proteins, primarily of the small subunit, and non-ribosomal proteins presumably involved in rRNA processing and assembly of the small 40S ribsomal subunit. While many proteins are found in both complexes, some are found in only one or the other. It may be that the 90S preribosome and SSU processome complexes are both intermediates in a series of complexes leading to the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit, or it may be that the SSU processome lies on an alternate assembly pathway. The 90S preribosome complex is described as corresponding to the earliest detectable rRNA processing and ribosome assembly complex. The 90S is itself assembled from a number of stable subcomplexes including the t-UTP subcomplex, the Pwp2p/UTP-B subcomplexwhich interacts directly with the 5-ETS of the 35S pre-rRNA, the UTP-C subcomplex, and the Mpp10 subcomplex. The t-UTP subcomplex is also found as part of the SSU processome complex, which is slightly smaller at 80S. Depletion of any of the members of the t-UTP subcomplex results in decreased transcription of rDNA leading to decreased levels of the primary 35S rRNA transcript. In contrast, mutation or depletion of most other members of either the 90S preribosome or SSU processome complexes causes decreased 18S rRNA levels without affecting the levels of the 25S or 5.8S rRNAs.Non-ribosomal protein components of the 90S preribosome and SSU processome Subunits of both the 90S preribosomeand SSU processomeinclude: Bud21p, Dip2p, Ecm16p, Emg1p, Imp3p, Imp4p, Krr1p, Mpp10p, Nan1p, Noc4p, Nop1p, Nop14p, Nop58p, Pwp2p, Rrp5p, Rrp9p, Nop56p, Sof1p, Utp4p, Utp6p, Utp7p, Utp8p, Utp9p, Utp10p, Utp13p, Utp15p, Utp18p, Utp20p, Utp21p, and Utp22p  Additional subunits of the 90S preribosomeinclude: Bfr2p, Bms1p, Cbf5p, Cms1p, Dbp8p, Dim1p, Enp1p, Enp2p, Has1p, Kre33p, Mrd1p, Nop9p, Pno1p, Prp43p, Rcl1p, Rok1p, Rrp12p, Scl1p, Slx9p, Tsr1p, and Utp30p  Additional subunits of the SSU processomeinclude: Fcf1p, Utp23p, Sas10p, Snu13p, Utp5p, Utp11p, and Utp14p"},{"body" : "DCI1 encodes an enzyme involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids.
